<i>July 4, 1910</i>.&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Geoffrey Rhodes</span>,</p>

<p>The appearance of your volume
is very welcome. There is, I believe, a real
need for such a work. You are to be congratulated
on the results of the energy and
patience which you have bestowed upon its
preparation. You have a true reward in the
support of writers so varied and conspicuous
in distinction as those whose names you have
been able to bring together.</p>

<p>You are enabling the whole reading world
to judge for itself, how the subject of
‘Spiritual,’ ‘Mental,’ or ‘Faith’ healing,
which during the past ten years has forced
itself upon public notice, is being regarded
by able, thoughtful, and impartial minds.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
There is no doubt that scientific medical men
are not going to pay attention to evidence of an
unscientific character. They will not waste
their time over it. Nevertheless, to phenomena
duly attested, and to evidence scientifically
recorded, they will give the most
scrupulous attention. It is the detailed and
accurate collection and classification of facts
by those who are trained for the task and
expert in its process, that must precede
generalisations upon this new, or shall we
call it, revived, branch of therapeutics.</p>

<p>Prejudice against it will be found to exist
both in ecclesiastic and in scientific circles.
Your book will help to dissipate prejudice by
the spread of better-informed opinion. The
time, indeed, is opportune. The <i>British
Medical Journal</i> of June 18, 1910, has published
a series of papers by men ‘who could
speak with the highest authority on the
relations between mind and body, as exhibited
in the phenomena of disease.’ ‘Their opinion,’
as the <i>Journal</i> tells us, ‘serves as an authoritative
reminder that there are bodily ills
which cannot be cured by pills and potions,
but which yield to methods which, for want
of a better word, may be called “mental”;
that cures which, in a former day, would
have been denied by unbelievers and accepted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
as miracles by the faithful, really happen,
and that they can be explained without
invoking supernatural intervention.’ On the
other hand, we are confident the Church of
Christ will never identify itself with charlatan
methods which might delude the poor and
the ignorant into the superstitious idea that
they can be more cheaply and effectively
healed by a magic or thaumaturgic ministry,
than by the knowledge and skill of trained
and certificated doctors and surgeons. To
quote our report in the Lambeth Conference
of 1908, ‘Medical science is the handmaid
of God and His Church’ (N.B. not of His
clergy, but of that Body of Christ in which
all true callings unite in serving), ‘and should
be fully recognised as the ordinary means
appointed by Almighty God for the care and
healing of the human body.’</p>

<p>The temper of our age favours an inquiry
conducted in a spirit which will neither
disregard the requirements of science, nor
rule miracles out of court as impossible. We
need not be anxious as to the results. It
looks, indeed, as if science were only just now
awaking to the realisation of its possibilities
through psychical treatment; and as if the
Church had never yet realised to the full its
responsibility and its power in ministration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
to sickness, and its influence over the reason
and the imagination.</p>

<p>‘Suspect everything,’ says St. Teresa, as
quoted by Sir Clifford Allbutt, ‘which weakens
the use of our reason; for by such a way,
we shall never attain to the liberty of the
Spirit.’ ‘Prayer,’ says the <i>British Medical
Journal</i>, in the article quoted above, ‘inspired
by a living faith, is a force acting within
the patient, which places him in the most
favourable condition for the stirring of the
pool of hope that lies, still and hidden it
may be, in the depths of human nature.’
Truly, it is a tribute to the intellectual temper
of our day that two such quotations, the
one from a medieval saint, the other from
a leading article in our modern medical
journal, can appropriately be adduced in
illustration of the spirit in which you have
edited your volume. I trust it will have
many readers. That it may promote the
wise and temperate study of spiritual and
mental, as well as of physical, forces and
disorders, is my earnest hope and desire.
That it may also tend to correct shallow and
superficial delusions on the part of ignorant
persons who imagine that they can dispense
with scientific knowledge, and ignore the
facts of mortality in suffering, disease, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
death, is an expectation which I pray may
be fulfilled.</p>

<p>Wishing, therefore, your volume all success,</p>

<p class="ml2em">I am, dear Mr. Geoffrey Rhodes,<br />
&emsp;&emsp;Yours very sincerely,<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span class="smcap">Herbert E. Winton</span>.</p>

</div>


<p>I have to acknowledge my indebtedness to
a host of kind people for help in compiling
this book. First of all to the many clergymen
and doctors who assisted me in finding
suitable contributors for the different chapters,
and then no less to the contributors themselves
who, in spite of the exigencies of professional
duties, managed not only to write for these
pages but to take part in many editorial discussions
often entailing lengthy interviews and
correspondence.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Winchester’s work in connexion
with this book has not been confined
to the Foreword which appears under his
name. I have had the benefit of his Lordship’s
advice and help throughout, and he has
spared the time to read all the essays in
manuscript.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span></p>

<p>My thanks are also due to Sir Thomas
Barlow and Sir Clifford Allbutt for assistance
in reading the proofs of the medical chapters.</p>

<p>Messrs. Macmillan and the Editors of the
<i>Hibbert Journal</i> and the <i>British Medical
Journal</i> have kindly allowed me to make
extracts.</p>

<h3>I</h3>
</div>

<p>In the Middle Ages practically the only homes
of learning were the monasteries. Here all
the knowledge of the time was taught and
all the studies carried on, so that under the
same roof the theologian, the chemist, the artist,
and the artificer sat side by side, and consequently
each drew from and modified the
study and practice of the other. In England,
at least, the dissolution of the monasteries
changed this order, and though the brilliancy
of the Renaissance for a time obscured the
loss to society in general, in the backwater
of the eighteenth century both religion and
medicine drifted into distinct circumscribed
professions. The dawn of the nineteenth
century saw an enormous revival of interest
and study in both directions, but the newfound
energy with which the two spheres of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
learning were pushed forward, proved in the
end inimical to the highest interests of the
community, for religion and medicine found
themselves carried farther and farther apart.</p>

<p>Before the stress of life became as severe
as it is to-day, most common complaints
could be overcome by rest and ordinary
treatment. But under modern conditions of
extreme complexity healing can no longer
be conducted on such simple lines, and as
time has gone on the effects of this divorce of
medicine and religion have made themselves felt.</p>

<p>In correspondence with a more highly organised
state of society, man has become a more
highly organised being. He has developed
faculties in excess of the man of, say, fifty
years ago, and the exercise of these faculties,
that depend for their operation on the nervous
system, entails a strain on that system to
which it was not exposed half a century
back. The more elaborate the machinery the
more ways in which it may get out of order.
Man to-day is prone to a dozen nervous
complaints whose existence our forefathers
were happily able to ignore. Owing to
climatic and other conditions that need not
be discussed here, these nervous disorders first
forced themselves on public attention in the
United States of America. The overworked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
business or professional man has no time
in the rushing life of the great growing cities
of America for rest. Carried off his feet by
the tide of prosperity, he becomes the slave
of his inventions instead of being their master.
His sense of proportion becomes atrophied
and he fails to maintain a correct balance
between thought and action. A purely
materialistic medicine that ignores thoughts
and feelings as being outside the scope of
diagnosis is powerless to prescribe for such a
case. And it is small matter for astonishment
that patients of this description have been
drifting into the hands of Christian Science
and kindred cults in their search for relief.
These systems of philosophy or religion (if
such they can be called) lack, however,
that element of completeness without which
no guide of human conduct can maintain its
hold. And as it becomes realised that these
irresponsible and often mercenary societies are
propagating views diametrically opposed to
the common-sense conceptions of the patients,
their power will be broken and the cures
cease. Meantime Christian Science undoubtedly
does overcome some cases of nervous
trouble, but these in no sense outweigh the
mischief done by its followers in denying the
sick medical care. We must clear the ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
before we can commence building, and it
may be well to examine briefly the ‘faith
and works’ of Christian Science before proceeding
to discuss the relationship between
Medicine and the Church.</p>

<p>Opening Mrs. Eddy’s handbook at random we
come across these two explanatory statements:</p>

<p>(1) It is not scientific to examine the
body in order to ascertain if we are in health.</p>

<p>(2) To employ drugs for the cure of disease
shows a lack of faith in God.</p>

<p>There is nothing new, of course, in these
two statements, nor anything peculiar to
Christian Science in them. They are put
forward by the majority of persons with these
views, whether they belong to the Peculiar
People or to Christian Science.</p>

<p>With Christian Science, as with all these
unorthodox and irregular religious healing
societies, it is almost impossible to find any
matter that is sufficiently definite to enable
one to form any conclusion of their objects.
They talk glibly about having effected cures
of various kinds of diseases, but on their own
showing there is absolutely no evidence to
prove that the individual ever had that
disease or any other form of disease. Mr.
Stephen Paget has very kindly allowed me
to make one or two extracts from his in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>valuable
work dealing with Christian Science.
He has, at great pains, collected cases of
Christian Science cures as reported in their
own official publications. It is only necessary
to read a few of these to see the absolute
hopelessness of getting at the bottom of them,
not merely from a medical standpoint but
from the point of view of common sense.
I would ask any person of average intelligence
to read the following five testimonies to healing
that Mr. Stephen Paget extracted from Mrs.
Eddy’s weekly journal, the <i>Christian Science
Sentinel</i>, and inform me if they convey any
impression whatsoever to his or her mind:</p>

<p>‘<i>Mrs. R.</i>&mdash;Healed of “sense of fatigue,
and throat trouble.” Also, when knocked
down by a bicyclist, she “suffered no pain
at all, and had little sense of shock.”&#8202;’</p>

<p>‘<i>Mrs. E.</i>&mdash;Was healed of the pain of a
burn. “The healing went on rapidly, and
in a very short time all manifestation of the
trouble disappeared.”&#8202;’</p>

<p>‘<i>Mr. W.</i>&mdash;Cured of drinking and smoking,
and of “stomach and throat <span class="nowrap">trouble.”&#8202;’<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span></p>

<p>‘<i>Mamie D.</i>&mdash;“I seemed to have burned
my hand very badly.” Healed.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>‘<i>Mrs. P.</i>&mdash;“Many physical ailments have
been met and overcome by Truth.”&#8202;’</p>

<p>And yet if they will refer to Mr. Paget’s
book they will find hundreds of similar instances.
In an appendix to the second edition
of his work Mr. Paget quotes the whole of
the correspondence in connexion with the
absent treatment of the Hon. A. Holland-Hibbert’s
mare, in 1900. This curious correspondence
needs no comment.</p>

<p>The following is an account <i>in extenso</i> of
an alleged cure by Christian Science taken from
an article in the <i>Twentieth Century Magazine</i>,
published in Boston, U.S.A., October 1909.</p>

<p>The contribution in question is from the
pen of the editor, Mr. B.&nbsp;O. Flower. I leave
my readers to form their own opinion on
this remarkable testimony.</p>

<p>‘On the morning of the dedication of
the Chicago Church, November 14, 1898, I
was in my bedroom in the third story of our
house (the house is three stories and basement).
I was getting ready to go to the morning
service, and my little daughter, five years
old, was playing about, when suddenly I felt
a silence. I instantly noticed that the child was
no longer there and that the window was open.’</p>

<p>‘I looked out and saw her unconscious
form on the ground below, her head on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
cement sidewalk. Instantly I thought, “All
is Love.”</p>

<p>‘As I went downstairs the entire paragraph
in “No and Yes,” page&nbsp;19, beginning,
“Eternal harmony, perpetuity, and perfection
constitute the phenomena of Being,” came to
me and took up its abode with me, and with it
the clear sense of the great gulf fixed between
the child and the lie that claimed to destroy.
The child was brought in, and as she was carried
upstairs she cried. As she was laid down,
the blood was spurting from her mouth, and
had already covered her neck and shoulders.
I instantly said, “There is one law&mdash;God’s
law&mdash;under which man remains perfect,” and
the bleeding immediately stopped. The child
seemed to relapse into unconsciousness,
but I declared, “Mind is ever present and
controls its idea,” and in a few moments
she slept naturally. During the morning
she seemed to suffer greatly if she was
moved at all, and her legs seemed paralysed,
lifeless. In the afternoon, all sense of pain
left, she slept quietly, and I went to the
afternoon service rejoicing greatly in my freedom
from the sense of personal responsibility.’</p>

<p>‘When I returned she sat in my lap to
eat some supper, with no sense of pain, but
still unable to control her limbs, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
presented the appearance of entire inaction.
At eight o’clock she was undressed without
inconvenience, and there was no mark on her
body but a bruised eye. During the day
she had not spoken of herself. At eleven
o’clock when I went upstairs, I found her wide
awake and she said: “Mamma, error is trying to
say that I fell out of the window, but that cannot
be. The child of God can’t fall; but why
do I lie here? Why can’t I move my legs?”</p>

<p>‘The answer was, “You can move them.
Mind governs, and you are always perfect.”
In a moment she said, “I will get up and
walk.” It seemed to require one or two
trials to get her legs to obey, but she rose,
walked across the room and back and climbed
into bed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She then sat up, ate a lunch,
fell into a natural slumber, and woke bright
and happy in the morning.’</p>

<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury gave a
solemn warning in connexion with this question
at a recent conference at Lambeth
Palace, and the following statement from the
medical side is important.</p>

<p>‘Christian Science seems to present one
fundamental point of difference from all other
forms of spiritual healing. This is, that
whereas the cures said to be wrought at
Lourdes and other shrines are attributed to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
direct action of Christ, exercised at the intercession
of His Virgin Mother or His Saints,
Mrs. Eddy and her disciples claim, as far as
we understand the teaching&mdash;which is not
only obscure in itself, but often inconsistent&mdash;to
cure disease by the same power of healing
that was given to Christ. In the sacred book
of the sect we read:</p>

<p>‘Our Master healed the sick, practised
Christian healing, and taught the generalities
of its divine Principle to His students; but He
left no definite rule for demonstrating His
Principle of healing and preventing disease.
This remained to be discovered through
Christian Science. A pure affection takes
form in goodness, but Science alone reveals
its Principle and demonstrates its rules.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span></p>

<p>She tells us that ‘when God called her to
proclaim His Gospel to this age, there came
also the charge to plant and water His vineyard.’
What she calls her ‘sacred discovery’
was made in 1866, and since then it has become
widespread in America and in this country.
It does not commend itself to the Latin mind,
which is nothing if not lucid and logical.
Its methods and results are fully discussed
by some representatives of the most advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
medical thought in the present issue of the
<i>Journal</i>, and we have nothing to add to
what they say. To anyone who wishes to see
the whole case against Christian Science put
most clearly and convincingly from the medical
point of view, we cordially recommend Mr.
Stephen Paget’s book on the subject<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> It
is attractively written, well ‘documented,’
and informed with the true scientific spirit.</p>

<p>We need say only one thing more about
Christian Science, which, to speak plainly,
is a repulsive subject, inasmuch as it shows,
in a way no other form of spiritual healing
does, the depths of degradation to which the
human mind can sink under the weight of
superstition. That it cures cases of the kind
that have been healed at all sorts of shrines&mdash;pagan,
Christian, Buddhist, Mohammedan&mdash;from
time immemorial, it would be idle to
deny. That it brightens the lives of some
persons who have no aim in life, and have
nothing to do but evoke pains and ailments
by thinking of their health, is also true. But,
none the less, its pretensions go far behind
anything that is credible, except by such as
accept Tertullian’s paradox, <i>Credo quia impossibile</i>;
and, instead of courting the light as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
other methods do, it seems to love the darkness.
We have asked over and over again
for facts that would convince a trained mind,
but none are forthcoming. Christian Science
may, indeed, be described as faith with the
least possible amount of works and the largest
possible number of words. Here are fair
specimens of the kind of facts which forms all
the evidence vouchsafed to us of its healing
efficacy; they are taken from the <i>Christian
Science Sentinel</i> of May 28, 1910, p.&nbsp;777:</p>

<p>‘A short time ago I was taken sick with
fever. My mother asked for Christian Science
treatment for me, and I was almost instantly
cured. I have been reading “Science and
Health, with Key to the Scriptures,” by
Mrs. Eddy, and have been benefited in business
and in health ever since. I am very grateful
for Christian Science, and thankful to God,
whence all good comes.</p>

<p class="sig">‘<span class="smcap">Fred. Werth</span>, Dallas, Tex.’</p>

<p>‘Some time ago I was attacked by stomach
and bowel trouble. A Christian Science practitioner
was called, and my ailment soon left
and I was again able to resume my duties.
I am very thankful for the good done me and
others, and praise God for speaking to us
through Mrs. Eddy.</p>

<p class="sig">‘<span class="smcap">Tillie Werth</span>, Dallas, Tex.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>There is nothing new in Christian Science
except the colossal impudence of its pretensions.
Mark Twain spoke in ignorance
when he said:</p>

<p>‘The Christian Scientist has taken a force
which has been lying idle in every member
of the human race since time began.’</p>

<p>We have shown that it was not left to Mrs.
Eddy to discover this force, and that, so far
from lying idle, it has been active in temples
and churches, at shrines and tombs, for thousands
of years. In one thing Christian Science
has probably a unique record of achievement:
beyond any sect or system that we know of
it has succeeded in exploiting human imbecility
and turning airy nothing into solid cash<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span></p>

<p>‘Every false system of philosophy, of
ethics, of morals, and of religion is floated
on the vast ocean of conduct, of character,
and of conviction by some element of truth.
This corresponds to a water-tight compartment
in a vessel which is in danger of being sunk,
through dishonest contracts, imperfect mechanism,
ignorant seamanship, or the stress and
strain of storm. But for this compartment,
the ship would disappear in the gurgling
green of the ocean. In the moral Order, and
in all our controversies, there is this unsink<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>able
truth. It keeps afloat all with which
it is for the time united, until the balance
is lost. Then the system is submerged. But
the truth sails on.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> In the case of the system
we have had under examination this truth
is the power of the mind over the body and
the efficacy of faith. Christian Science undoubtedly
cures certain kinds of neurotic
troubles, just as it may do incalculable harm
by teaching that scientific medicine is not only
useless but mischievous. If its followers confined
themselves to merely enunciating the
truth on which the flimsy superstructure is
founded little could be urged against them.
As we have seen, however, by a careful examination
of their official records, they contradict
the cardinal doctrines of the Christian Churches,
and encourage a disregard for all bodily complaints
that is not merely foolish in the
extreme, but where the sufferings of others
are concerned, distinctly brutal, and in either
case often leads to the most disastrous results.</p>

<p>This indictment is a serious one. But
then the claims of Mrs. Eddy’s supporters are
so portentous that they cannot be lightly dismissed,
and we must not forget that, as the
Bishop of Birmingham points out in a letter
printed further on in this volume, both the Church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
and the medical profession have played into the
hands of Christian Science by ignoring the facts
that Mrs. Eddy has been occupied in distorting.</p>

<p>However much it may have been possible
in the past for the doctor and the parson in
dealing with the less nervous, more easy-going
type to look upon him as composed of two
distinct and separate parts, body and spirit
respectively, having no intimate relationship
and amenable to quite different influences,
such a view of men and women is to-day out
of the question. To entertain it for a moment
is to court failure. Mind and matter act
and react upon one another, and more than
this, without faith all human enterprise would
be stultified. Faith plays no less important
a part in medical treatment than it does in
the more commonplace affairs of life. This
aspect of the question cannot be better expressed
than it has been recently by Professor Osler<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span></p>

<p>‘Nothing in life is more wonderful than
faith&mdash;the one great moving force which we
can neither weigh in the balance nor test in
the crucible. Intangible as the ether, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>eluctable
as gravitation, the radium of the
moral and mental spheres, mysterious, indefinable,
known only by its effects, faith pours
out an unfailing stream of energy while
abating nor jot nor tittle of its potency. Well
indeed did St. Paul break out into the well-known
glorious panegyric, but even this
scarcely does justice to the Hertha of the
psychical world, distributing force as from
a great storage battery, without money and
without price to the children of men.’</p>

<p>Three of its relations concern us here.
The most active manifestations are in the
countless affiliations which man in his evolution
has worked out with the unseen, with the
invisible powers, whether of light or of darkness,
to which from time immemorial he has
erected altars and shrines. To each one of
the religions, past or present, faith has been the
Jacob’s ladder. Creeds pass; an inexhaustible
supply of faith remains, with which man proceeds
to rebuild temples, churches, chapels, and
shrines. As Swinburne says in that wonderful
poem, <i>The Altar of Righteousness</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">God by God flits past in thunder, till his glories turn to shades:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">God to God bears wondering witness how his gospel flames and fades.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More was each of these, while yet they were, than man their servant seemed:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dead are all of these, and man survives who made them while he dreamed.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>And all this has been done by faith, and
faith alone. Christendom lives on it, and
countless thousands are happy in the possession
of that most touching of all confessions, ‘Lord!
I believe; help Thou my unbelief.’ But,
with its Greek infection, the Western mind is
a poor transmitter of faith, the apotheosis of
which must be sought in the religions of the
East. The nemesis of faith is that neither
in its intensity nor in its effects does man
find any warrant of the worthiness of the
object on which it is lavished&mdash;the followers
of Joe Smith, the Mormon, are as earnest
and believing as are those of Confucius!</p>

<p>Again, faith is the cement which binds
man to man in every relation of life. Without
faith in the Editor of the <i>Journal</i> I would not
have accepted his invitation to write this
brief note, and he had confidence that I
would not write rubbish. Personally I have
battened on it these thirty-six years, ever since
the McGill Medical Faculty gave me my first
mount. I have had faith in the profession,
the most unbounded confidence in it as one
of the great factors in the progress of humanity;
and one of the special satisfactions of my life
has been that my brethren have in many
practical ways shown faith in me, often
much more than (as I know in my heart of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
hearts) I have deserved. I take this illustration
of the practical value of the faith that worketh
confidence, but there is not a human relationship
which could not be used for the same purpose.</p>

<p>And a third aspect is one of very great
importance to the question in hand&mdash;a man
must have faith in himself to be of any use
in the world. There may be very little on
which to base it&mdash;no matter, but faith in one’s
powers, in one’s mission, is essential to success.
Confidence once won, the rest follows naturally;
and with a strong faith in himself a man
becomes a local centre for its radiation. St.
Francis, St. Theresa, Ignatius Loyola, Florence
Nightingale, the originator of every cult or
sect or profession, has possessed this infective
faith. And in the ordinary everyday work
of the doctor, confidence, assurance (in the
proper sense of the word) is an asset without
which it is very difficult to succeed. How
often does one hear the remark, ‘Oh! he
does not inspire confidence,’ or the reverse!
How true it is, as wise old Burton says:
‘That the patient must have a sure hope in
his physician. Damascen, the Arabian, requires
likewise in the physician himself that he be
confident he can cure him, otherwise his
physic will not be effectual, and promise
withal that he will certainly help him, make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
him believe so at least. Galeottus gives this
reason because the form of health is contained
in the physician’s mind, and as Galen holds
confidence and hope to be more good than
physic, he cures most in whom most are
confident’; and he quotes Paracelsus to the
effect that Hippocrates was so fortunate in
his cures not from any extraordinary skill,
but because ‘the common people had a most
strong conceit of his worth.’</p>

<p>Faith is indeed one of the miracles of human
nature which science is as ready to accept
as it is to study its marvellous effects. When
we realise what a vast asset it has been in
history, the part which it has played in the
healing art seems insignificant, and yet there
is no department of knowledge more favourable
to an impartial study of its effects; and this
brings me to my subject&mdash;the faith that heals.</p>

<p>Apart from the more specific methods to
be dealt with faith has always been an essential
factor in the practice of medicine, as illustrated
by the quotations just given from Burton.
Literature is full of examples of remarkable
cures through the influence of the imagination,
which is only an active phase of faith. The
late Daniel Hack Tuke’s book, ‘The Influence
of the Mind on the Body,’ is a storehouse of
facts dealing with the subject. ‘While in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
general use for centuries, one good result of the
recent development of mental healing has been
to call attention to its great value as a measure
to be carefully and scientifically applied in
suitable cases. My experience has been that
of the unconscious rather than the deliberate
faith healer. Phenomenal, even what could
be called miraculous, cures are not very
uncommon. Like others, I have had cases
any one of which, under suitable conditions,
could have been worthy of a shrine or made
the germ of a pilgrimage. For more than ten
years a girl lay paralysed in a New Jersey
town. A devoted mother and loving sisters
had worn out lives in her service. She had
never been out of bed unless when lifted by
one of her physicians, Dr. Longstreth and Dr.
Shippen. The new surroundings of a hospital,
the positive assurance that she could get well
with a few simple measures sufficed, and
within a fortnight she walked round the
hospital square. This is a type of modern
miracle that makes one appreciate how readily
well-meaning people may be deceived as to
the true nature of the cure effected at the
shrine of a saint. Who could deny the miracle?
And miracle it was, but not brought about
by any supernatural means.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span></p>

<p>If, then, faith is so important an adjuvant
to ordinary medical treatment, we see at once
that religion that stands for faith in its highest
and purest form should represent a tremendous
recuperative force. We have said that medicine
and religion had become estranged&mdash;the one
given over to a rigid materialism, and the
other so busy with men’s souls that it forgot
their bodies altogether. This book is a humble
attempt to bridge over the gulf. There is a
great movement that has its roots in history
that is already written and that will go on into
the far distant future, around about us. It
is a movement that stands for Idealism and
Optimism. It is the harmonising of all kinds
of human experience into one great philosophy.
Scientific medicine is coming to reconsider
its position and to realise its responsibilities.
This synchronises with a broadening of the
basis of Christian teaching. Without abandoning
any of the cardinal tenets of their faith,
the churches are coming to see that Christianity
is a much more wonderful truth than
they had ever dreamed; and, instead of
there being any conflict between Christianity
and science, science, like all work for the good
of humanity, must be an integral part of the
Church’s service to mankind.</p>

<p>Medicine and religion had a common origin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
in pagan temples, and we have already seen
that in medieval times all such learning was
the monopoly of the monks. Healing by
means of influence on the mind of the patient
is no newer a branch of the art than surgery
or treatment by drugs. History abounds
with instances of cures effected at shrines
by means of relics, and by saints. Of all
modern pilgrimage shrines the one in the
Pyrenees is by far the most famous. That
cures actually take place at the Grotto of
Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception at
Lourdes is undeniable. The cases have been
medically diagnosed and the certificates may
be examined in the Record Office at Lourdes
where such documents are preserved. Whether
such cures differ in character from other cures
by what is termed suggestion is an open
question. In fairness to those who believe
them to be due to the direct intervention of the
Almighty it is perhaps only right to give here
the opinion of Mr. Butlin, the President of the
Royal College of Surgeons, who recently
said:</p>

<p>‘When such cures take place in the
presence of vast masses of people, although
it may be possible to explain all the steps
through which the emotion has produced the
“cure,” how can we be surprised that the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
fall on their knees before God and bless His holy
name for the miracle which He has wrought?</p>

<p>‘I defy anyone to read Zola’s story of the
cure of Marie le Guersaint, written by a
sceptic (Zola’s “Lourdes”), without being
moved by it and without feeling convinced
that all true Catholics who were present,
priests and people, with the unhappy exception
of the Abbé Pierre Froment, truly believed
that Almighty God had been moved by the
intercession of Our Lady of the Immaculate
Conception to display His divine power by
instantaneously restoring the health of the poor
girl who had lain paralysed upon a couch
for seven years. In the eyes of all who
witnessed it, it was a miracle, for every
medical man who had seen her had, with
one exception, believed her to be suffering from
a damaged spinal cord. There is therefore no
excuse, in such a case as this or in ninety-nine
out of one hundred cases which are
cured by faith, to impute dishonesty and
deliberate deception to the priests and the
people who proclaim such cures to be the work
of God. From the little I have seen of the
priests actively engaged in the grotto at
Lourdes, I can feel no doubt that the most of
them honestly believe that the cures which they
have seen are genuine. I would no more think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
of accusing them of deliberate deception than
I would accuse my own relative of it.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span></p>

<p>We have spoken of a great movement,
that tends to bring into closer co-operation
all human effort and to consecrate it to one
ideal&mdash;the service of mankind.</p>

<p>We are here more particularly concerned
with a smaller movement that exists within
the greater. It has made itself felt at Church
Conferences and at Medical Councils. It is a
movement to bring the medical profession
and the Church into a closer practical connexion
to fight disease. That such an
intimate co-operation is not only desirable
but possible, the thoughtful chapters contributed
to this book by eminent authorities
go to show. As regards the general principle
underlying this joint work for the sick, the
Archdeacon of London recently gave expression
to what would appear to be the feeling
of the leading ecclesiastics and foremost
physicians in his charge to the clergy of
his archdeaconry in the following words:</p>

<p>‘Religion and medical science should always
co-operate, while the ultimate responsibility
must lie with the accredited physician.’</p>

<p>When the scheme for the present volume
was drawn up over a year ago, it was felt that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
some authoritative statement was needed to
guide the public in thinking out the topical
questions of Spiritual Faith or Mental Healing.
There has, in recent years, been an endless
series of books issued from the European and
American presses on this subject. Some of
these publications being obviously the hand-books
of societies whose name spelt their
own condemnation, thinking people passed
them by, but, on the other hand, much literature
of a very misleading character has been
placed on the market and purchased by many
in the belief that they were learning from it
the official views either of the Church or of
the medical profession, or of both. The
qualified medical practitioners of this country
do not lightly decide to give expression to their
views on therapeutics in books issued to
the general public, and whenever they circulate
opinions it may be taken for granted that
they are the result of patient investigation
of facts and of carefully thought out conclusions
deduced from those facts. If one
may be allowed to indicate in a general way
the position taken up by the doctors who
have written for the following pages, it is one
of scepticism towards quasi-miraculous healing
as a practical means of combating disease,
but at the same time it is an attitude of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
extreme cordiality towards the minister of
religion&mdash;in his capacity as a messenger of hope
and expert in peace of mind. Of all the weighty
evidence that has been gathered together to
build up this book, the opinion of Sir Clifford
Allbutt forms no unimportant section. Few
of us can escape sickness altogether, and
although some illnesses may be blessings
in disguise, nevertheless our desire for health
is only second to our desire for life, and it is
right that it should be so. ‘The highest
spiritual life depends on the best bodily
health,’ Sir Clifford Allbutt tells us. The
Bishops at Lambeth admitted with regret
that ‘sickness has too often exclusively been
regarded as a cross to be borne with passive
resignation, whereas it should have been regarded
rather as a weakness to be overcome
by the power of the spirit.’ That there exist
potentialities of healing apart from physic
to-day no one can refute, but it is to be feared
the Church and the medical profession have
much lost ground to recover, through having
in the past ignored those psychic forces that
are now the object both of scientific inquiry
and of theological study. The marvellous
chemical discoveries of the past few years
have revolutionised scientific conceptions. New
theories of matter and of energy are being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
framed to explain the result of new researches.
The wonders of radio-activity have converted
the scientist from a materialist who believed
in nothing unrevealed by test-tube or microscope,
into an idealist prepared to argue from
the unseen to the seen. Just as there are in
the world of physical science forces whose
existence we are only now beginning to
recognise and whose capabilities are still
unknown to us, there are undoubtedly psychic
forces in man that are capable of development,
but of whose exact nature we at present
are ignorant, although we can trace their
effects<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span></p>

<p>‘In the case of vital truth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it may
be necessary for a writer to say some hard
things,’ but criticism, prompted by no petty
spirit, but by a noble desire to bring out the
best, will never be resented by right-minded
people. Two great and noble professions are
about to make a combined attack on sickness
and suffering. They have too great a sense
of their responsibility to enter upon such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
campaign lightly. Much counsel is needed
before the allies can give battle.</p>

<p>The respective spheres of action of the cleric
and the doctor have to be mapped out; so that
all the efforts of the one may support and never
hamper the other.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the medical contributors,
not unreasonably, seriously deprecate
any attempt on the part of the minister of
religion to invade the province of medicine.
Such intrusion is none the less dangerous
because it may be unintentional. All ‘treatment,’
whether it be by means of drugs, surgery,
or hypnotic suggestion, must necessarily be a
matter for the doctor and those working under
his immediate direction: and for them only.
In so far as he may be concerned with physical
disabilities the priest must inevitably defer to
the physician.</p>

<p>At the same time the value of spiritual
ministrations in sickness is emphasised on every
page of this book.</p>

<p>‘Probably no limb, no viscus is so far a
vessel of dishonour as to lie wholly outside the
renewals of the spirit,’ says Sir Clifford Allbutt.
But we may go further than this in certain
directions. Remembering that the health of
mind and body are mutually dependent, and
that troublesome thoughts may bring sickness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
in their train, we see that there may exist
sicknesses that are not amenable to medical
treatment only. These are among the ills that
the <i>British Medical Journal</i> has told us cannot
be cured by pills and potions alone.</p>

<p>Dr. Jane Walker writes pertinently on this,
under the heading of ‘The Relationship of Priest
and Doctor to Patient.’ As she points out, when
a character has to be remoulded, it is the priest
rather than the doctor who can best help the
patient.</p>

<p>‘A true and philosophic religion raises the
mind above incidental emotionalism and gives
stability,’ says Dr. Hyslop: this is the stand-point
adopted by all the eminent theologians
who have written for this book.</p>

<p>Mental and physical pain is part of the evil
in the world. It makes a great difference,
however&mdash;it may be all the difference between
sickness and health&mdash;whether we allow trouble
to break down our self-control and weaken our
will, or whether we face it boldly with a
supreme serenity of spirit, strong in a knowledge
of greater things.</p>

<h3>II</h3>
</div>


<p>In the course of gathering opinions from
various authoritative sources on the subject
dealt with in this book, I received communications
from Sir Clifford Allbutt, the Hon.
Sydney Holland, and a well-known surgeon,
which, though they do not constitute separate
treatises, are so important, not only in view of
the distinction of the authors, but of the broad
survey of the subject that they afford, that I
venture to print them as part of the general
introduction.</p>

<p>In the case of Sir Clifford Allbutt’s paper
I have supplemented it by an important
extract from one of his recent writings.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Relationship between Medicine
and Religion</span></h4>

<p>The response you are good enough to
desire can be but brief, crude, and, I fear,
too blunt; but I have not time for careful
consideration. I can only indicate a few points<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
which occur to me offhand, and taking much
for granted. For instance, I must avoid
any discussion of those antinomies which
meet us at every side of human conceptions,
and be content to accept the common uses.
The chief of these (for the moment) is that of
the material and spiritual; without forgetting
that they melt at their borders the one
into the other, and that we meet with
corresponding ambiguities, yet I must take
them as distinct fields of human life. In
our interesting personal conversation you may
remember that I expressed the opinion that,
on the whole, our prayers must not be for
material but for spiritual things. And, speaking
on the whole, sickness is a material thing.
In the stories of our Lord’s miracles it has
always struck me that He regarded His
miracles&mdash;I must use the word for brevity&mdash;apologetically.
The disciples were not to tell
any man of them; or again, a miracle was
performed under a compelling sense of the
overwhelming faith of the pleader, which
was the main thing. Faith, prayer, were to
be for the needs of the soul, not of the body.
For instance, the father seeing his child in
diphtheria would please God better&mdash;so the
experience of His world tells us&mdash;by spending
his first hour in seeking the physician with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
his antidote rather than in prayer for a
divine intervention. And when time came
for prayer he would pray not for a suspension
of natural law but for unity of his own will
with that of the Father, and for the child’s
spiritual welfare. Into the origin of evil do not
fear that I shall enter; it is one of the antinomies
which I have said that we must
avoid, at any rate at present: I can only now
say that disease is a material effect to be
combated by material means, and not by
religious processions or intercessions.</p>

<p>This being my view, I would try to
eliminate notions of the priest as medicine
man; they are essentially pagan, though
to this day they more or less unconsciously
influence our thoughts on the present subject.</p>

<p>But, it may be said, strange healings do
take place under religious influences; and
this is true. And at no time in history were
such miraculous cures more frequent and
wonderful than in the temples of Aesculapius
or of Serapis. Modern cures, whether of the
Eddyites or at Lourdes, or the like elsewhere,
when compared with those of the Roman
Empire fall into insignificance. Now a careful
study of all reported cures of this miraculous
or miraculoid kind, a study illustrated for us
many years ago by Charcot, proved to him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
and proves to the expert observers of to-day,
that they all&mdash;palsies, convulsions and the rest,
often inveterate cases&mdash;are and have been
cures of one disease, and of one only, namely
hysteria; a malady which in its protean
manifestations mocks all and any particular
diseases. I say this of the genuine cases; but
the majority of such wonders recorded turn
out on inquiry (like the ‘Grimsby’ case) to
be grossly exaggerated or wholly false. The
‘miraculous cures’ then, so far as they are
genuine, are cures by suggestion: they take
their place with cures of the same kind of
disorder by panic, such as an alarm of fire;
by ‘hypnotism,’ or by any other over-mastering
impression which startles or transports
the balance of the bodily functions from
one centre of equilibrium to another higher
and more stable one.</p>

<p>So much for the ‘miracles’; which owe
nothing to any sacerdotal magic, and to the
physician are part of a familiar experience,
and of a familiar interpretation. But giving
up the hysterical cases&mdash;which, by the way, is
to give up a good deal&mdash;and admitting that
disease is in the body a material thing, and
one not properly matter for the pleading of
prayer, except in the spiritual sense of submission
to the Divine order, between these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
positions is there a sphere in which spiritual
influences&mdash;whether by a clergyman or a
Biblewoman or a gentle friend&mdash;may so infuse
peace and confidence into a sick man as to
promote even in the body a renewal, a conversion,
or an economy of energy which should
make for recovery? Certainly; and here, I
think, is the restricted, if still important,
sphere of religion as medical.</p>

<p>To consider this aspect of the matter
we must go back for a moment to certain
principles. From the letters of Teresa&mdash;that
noble saint&mdash;we may learn much of the greatest
value to us in the present inquiry. We may
learn from her to distrust the ‘ecstasies and
melancholies’ which&mdash;as she said&mdash;were ‘the
perils of conventual life’; she roundly denounced
all that ‘letting one’s self go, outside
the control of reason,’ which has its origin
in ‘sick brains.’</p>

<p>‘If I were with you,’ she wrote to a
certain Prioress, ‘you would not have
so many extraordinary experiences.’ Now
Teresa not only apprehended, but thoroughly
understood, that the highest spiritual life
depends upon the best bodily health. She
tells us that she supported her own vigils
with plenty of meat (<i>viande</i>) and sleep. High
and holy thought demands the greatest effort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
of the healthiest body, of the brain most
finely balanced and best nourished. The piety
of the sick-bed is at best a passive piety, which
on recovery is pushed aside again by the
custom of the world; but herein it is that in
sickness the soul flags and droops upon itself,
and that the support of other sympathy is more
precious. The sympathy we all depend on in
health we need most when enfeebled by
ailment. There is no delusion more terrible
than that which lets a man run up a score of
sins and negligences to be repented of under
the discouragement of a sick-bed. In this
melancholy, this debility, this disappointment,
perhaps this remorse, energy is wasted which
is sorely required for the conflict with disease.
And even the man of religious life likewise&mdash;if
in less degree, as one who has accumulated
more inward light&mdash;is also disheartened to
perceive that the fountains of spiritual contemplation
are then less copious, and aspiration
a wearier effort. He too needs help, if not
to make, yet to reinforce, the happier conversations
of his fuller life. In health the
mind in solitude droops and wastes, and the
sick-bed is a kind of solitude; the thousand
and one stimulating impressions of common
life cease, the impressions wane which should
keep the mind and soul awake, and fill the wells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
of energy. On the sick-bed, therefore, short
times of encouragement and sympathy, periods
not long enough to exhaust the scanty stores
of energy, are precious; and if the physician be
jealous&mdash;as it has been said&mdash;of the priest, it is
lest he should expend these stores more in
priestly functions than in ‘angels’ visits’
of love and hope which would unite and
reinforce the vacillating and fading forces.
Thus also prayer at the bedside and the short
communions should be of love and hope,
not particular requests for material relief or
cure. The kindly physician himself may be a
vehicle of much of this encouragement; but&mdash;as
I said to you before&mdash;he should avoid
even the semblance of attending to anything
beside his own business of material aid and
general human sympathy. The most pious
patient, openly or inwardly, resents the divided
mind. The instinct of self-preservation is not
lost even in those nearest to God.</p>

<p>So when all is said and done on this
subject I fear that matters for me remain
much where they were before; but they may
lead to a more intimate understanding of
the several parts of the spiritual and the
medical visitors, and to a completer sympathy
between them. If still it be urged that an
imposing ceremony may, by a measure of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
‘suggestion’ so effective in the many-coloured
hysteria, come to our aid in more noxious
maladies, if no more than on the fringe of
them, I should repeat that the advantage
would be so indefinite, so relatively small,
and so well to be attained by ordinary spiritual
visitation, as not to be worth the peril of the
moral perversion which hangs only too closely
around these good intentions, the peril of
imposing upon, even of bamboozling, the
patient. We must remember the saying of
Lavoisier, ‘Medicine came into the world with
a twin brother, called charlatanism.’</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Clifford Allbutt.</span></p>


<p class="mt15em">Extract from Sir Clifford Allbutt’s paper
in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, June 18, 1910:</p>

<p>‘Spiritual gifts may or may not consist
in the insertion of a new entity, they certainly
do consist in a reanimation and remodelling
of thinking matter in the uppermost strands
of the brain, and probably of some other,
perhaps even of all the other, molecular
activities of the body. Probably no limb, no
viscus is so far a vessel of dishonour as to lie
wholly outside the renewals of the spirit;
and to an infinite intelligence every accession
of spiritual life would be apparent in a new
harmony (συγγυμνασία) of each and all of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
metabolic streams and confluences of the body.
On this conviction it is that the hopes and
methods of faith healing depend. Conversely,
every man who watches his own life must know
this, as in time of weariness or pain he grieves
over the drooping of his soul, that the highest
spiritual life depends on the highest bodily
health; but this health means, not health
only of the belly, not only health of the heart
and common brain, but also of the rarest and
most exquisite textures of the cerebral web.
If in a rude health of the grosser body these
subtlest parts have not been exercised and
cherished, the total harmony is diminished;
highly efficient as, on lower planes, the particular
body may be, it is defective in comprehensions,
it is an inconsummate body.
To this “materialism” of the body, even on
its most spiritual planes of structure, we must
not close our eyes lest in our search beyond
knowledge we walk contrary to knowledge.
“To pray well,” said the noble Teresa, “one
must eat well and sleep well.” If into the
last analysis the Pauline division between
the carnal and the spiritual cannot be carried,
if under the relations of other times and of
other ideas we have to re-interpret it, yet still
in its broader contrasts it points out a plain
way of life and conduct&mdash;one so plain that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
perplexities of the middle terms may be left to
the casuist.</p>

<p>‘It must be granted then, in respect of
faith healing, that spiritual influences, divine
directly, or indirectly through human mediation,
may to some unknown power radiate
from these highest currents downward through
the more and more “material” planes,
arousing them less and less as they have become
more and more statical in order.</p>

<p>‘Once more; it is said that in his “subliminal
self” man possesses a substance peculiarly
divine, or a substance or means through which
we may reach divine communion, or through
which especially divine purposes may be
fulfilled in us. It is true that we do not
know even approximately the content of the
individual man, the materials racially and
personally acquired, the products of past experience,
racial and personal, built sensibly and
insensibly into his personality. May we not
each of us be compared with a ship which
began its voyage with no inconsiderable rudimentary
equipment, then, calling at many a
port, has gathered many kinds of stores and
treasure? Of some of these stores, of some
variety of them, the supercargo has a recollection,
especially of those in frequent use; but,
for the most part, the bills of lading had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
lost. Unlike a cargo, however, these contents
are not a passive burden, but a system
of coefficients; some on planes which we
commonly call material, some on spiritual
planes, some working on the surface, some
working stealthily within; so that much tact
and insight are necessary to unveil and to re-animate
those agencies in whose abeyance
disorder or ineffectualness may happen to
consist. And the influences which are to
effect these revivals must be akin in nature
to these kinds respectively; some must be
solidly material&mdash;such as splints or drugs&mdash;some
must be religious, moral, and even
intellectual, yet inspired by emotion, by appeal
to hope and joy; and their instruments must
be devotion, sympathy, gladness, reasonable
persuasion, and even surprise.’</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Religion and Medicine in the Hospital</span></h4>

<p>No one who has been connected with one of
our big general hospitals can doubt for a
moment the advisability of the collaboration
of the physician and the clergyman, each
helping the patient from his own standpoint.
It must not be imagined that I advocate any
usurping of the duties of one by the other,
but in the cure of certain types of disease,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
and certainly in the cure of diseases that
are primarily diseases of mind or character,
the doctor should welcome the minister of
religion as a valuable ally. In fact none can
doubt that the minister of religion can bring
a power to bear on the mind of a patient,
which the doctor cannot.</p>

<p>Whatever his own personal belief may be,
the medical man can of course only view
religion from a philosophic or ethical stand-point.
It is difficult for him to concern himself
with dogma. The clergyman can help by
administering suggestions of hope and encouragement.
These suggestions can and do often
come from other sources with equal results, but
I think by virtue of his office the clergyman
is specially qualified for the work.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that cures of
certain kinds of diseases have been effected
by Christian Science and kindred faith-healing
cults, all of which cures come under the head
of healing by suggestion. I do not think
that healing disease by suggestion is specially
a Christian work, it can be achieved in many
ways. But I think the average medical man
likely to be more willing to seek the aid of a
duly accredited minister of religion than a
so-called ‘Spiritual Healer’ who is subject to
no authority. But above and beyond all this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
I think the quieting and encouraging influences
of religion are of the greatest value in all illness,
and I believe a greater use might be made of
such power.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Sydney Holland.</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Surgeon, the Clergyman, and the
Patient</span></h4>

<p>Possibly the gravest shock that a human
being may receive, so far as it concerns himself
or herself, is to be told that fatal disease is
present in the system. So great may be
the actual shock that many a medical practitioner
shrinks from inflicting it, and purposely
avoids direct allusion to the certainty
of dissolution. Whether this is justifiable
or no, depends very largely upon the susceptibilities
of the patient and the tact of the
doctor. But the word ‘operation’ is, by some,
almost as much dreaded as the word ‘death’;
in fact even more, as it always implies to the
lay mind the infliction of hours of pain, and
days of discomfort, though this is far from
being the truth in most instances.</p>

<p>‘Rather let me die than make me undergo
an operation’ is the not infrequent remark
of the highly-strung sufferer. And then comes
in all the sympathy, tact, and good breeding
of the surgeon. He will gently explain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
matters, will show how the disease is such
that nothing short of removal of the growth
holds out the least chance of life or the avoidance
of later severe pain, and will state, what
is the truth, that the operation, short and
sharp, will give years of freedom from suffering
even if it does not completely remove all
trace of the trouble. How bewildered the
patient will feel! He has been hoping against
hope that his malady is only a slight one,
and that it may be ‘dispersed’ by some magic
of physic, and now his hopes have been rudely
mocked and shattered. Surely here, if ever, help
from an outside source is needed and should be
welcomed. But such help must be rational,
based on truth, and fearing not the consequences.</p>

<p>Supposing the disease is cancer, what awaits
him if the sufferer flies to the quack and is
befooled till all hope of successful treatment
is gone? Or rushes to the Christian Scientist,
who, with seeming <i>bona fides</i>, avers there is no
such thing as a cancer cell! The eye that
has seen it a hundred times under the microscope,
and can recognise it amongst a hundred
other varieties, does not exist in the purblind
conception of such a ‘Scientist,’ for the cell
is matter, it cannot exist, and neither for
the same reasoning, if consistency is maintained,
can the eye which sees the cell exist,
for it also is material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<p>And still as the growth increases there is the
lurking certainty ever protruding itself that
after all the surgeon was right, and the days
are slipping by. Would that friends could
be true and friends indeed, and not in ignorance
hinder these circumstances, not mere blind
leaders of the blind.</p>

<p>It is here if anywhere the enlightened
clergyman and the surgeon may join hands
for the good of spirit and body. And then
when a decision has been arrived at calmly
and deliberately, and the time of the operation
has been fixed, there is still work for both the
minister and the surgeon to do. A quiet talk
and prayer the evening before the ordeal, how
it has often soothed the trembling soul, and
invoked a night of rest and refreshment,
enabling the patient to meet the trials of the
morning calm, because mentally and physically
there has been repose.</p>

<p>And the surgeon with his cheering word,
and the anæsthetist with his quiet reassuring
manner and conversation, both tend to allay
any fresh alarm at that which is perhaps the
most trying moment of all&mdash;the placing oneself
unreservedly in the hands of the operator.</p>

<p>Surely, surely here is a period when the
efforts of the spiritual are to crown the success
of the material.</p>

<p>And then, observe how the quiet and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
confidence, engendered by the combined efforts
of pastor and doctor, continue during convalescence,
causing that period to be shortened
in many a case.</p>

<p>In a hundred different ways members of
the two professions may work hand in hand,
but each should be able to mutually esteem
the other and give to each his proper place
and function. They ought never to despise
one another, because they ought never to
encroach on one another’s province.</p>

<p>Till the clergyman recognises that it is his
duty to understand something of elementary
physiology, if he is going to be a benefactor
to spirit and body, and the medical practitioner
is willing to admit that there are spiritual
forces which can be brought to help the perfection
of his work, so long is it the opinion
of the writer that the sufferer who looks
to both of them for aid will fail to receive
his full due of assistance. May the time soon
come when the rising generation of all classes
may be so taught at school, and in church,
that they will come to understand something
of the composition and need of the tripartite
nature of man, and may the day speedily dawn
when the enlightened clerical and medical
professions mutually work for the good of the
whole, spirit, soul and body.</p>

<p>Widespread interest has been taken of late in
what is called ‘Spiritual Healing,’ or ‘Healing
by Spiritual means’; interest which is manifest
from the popularity of such books as ‘Religion
and Medicine,’ and ‘Body and Soul,’ no less
than from the thoughtful articles contributed
to this volume by many eminent authorities.
Yet it may be observed that, although some
of these contributors belong to the profession
of medicine, it is doubtful if many medical
men are acquainted with the objects and
purpose of Spiritual Healing, and probably
few of them regard the movement seriously.
It is unwise, however, to adopt an attitude of
indifference towards the aspirations of earnest
men, so that it seems well to attempt to
define the position of medicine with regard
to such methods of healing, to investigate the
cures alleged, to utter some warning as to
possible dangers, and to inquire how far the
results justify the movement, and to what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
extent it is possible to adapt the processes
of Spiritual Healing to recognised forms of
treatment.</p>

<p>Spiritual Healing has been hailed with
enthusiasm by certain members of the Church
of England, under the impression that it constitutes
a resumption of the early powers of
Christianity as evidenced in the miracles of
healing ascribed to Christ and His Apostles.
A theological discussion as to the possibility
of miracles occurring at the present day is
outside the scope of this article, but it would be
well to define the standpoint from which the
medical man approaches all investigations
connected with disease.</p>

<p>The researches of scientists are conducted
by the methods of observation, experiment,
and induction; it is the medical man’s duty to
observe symptoms, to experiment as to their
cause, to investigate possible remedies, and
to apply these to the relief or cure of disease.
In recent times much has been done towards
elucidating the influences of mind upon body
and its diseases; but so far questions connected
with the Spirit have been regarded as
outside the scope of medicine.</p>

<p>The minister of religion, on the other hand,
has been content hitherto to leave questions
of physical health to be dealt with by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
doctor; he has not interfered to any extent
in mental questions, and his chief concern has
been with what is called the ‘Spirit.’ It would
seem a little difficult to define the attributes of
Spirit, or to draw a sharp line of division
between spirit and mind; but, however this
may be, spirit has usually been considered as
opposed to matter, and no influence over the
material diseases of the body has been ascribed
to it. Whatever views the Church may have
held as to the miracles of healing mentioned
in the New Testament, she has to some extent
kept them in the background; and it is possible
that they might have remained there, but for
the success obtained by certain irrational
cults that have sprung into being, with the
object apparently of abolishing both parson
and doctor. The foundation on which all
these sects are based would seem to be a
passage in the Epistle of St. James, chap. v.
verses 14, 15, which reads as follows: ‘Is any
sick among you? let him call for the elders
of the Church; and let them pray over him,
anointing him with oil in the name of the
Lord: and the prayer of faith shall save the
sick, and the Lord shall raise him up.’</p>

<p>Again this is no place to go into theological
discussions, such as whether ‘elder’ can be
taken to mean ‘priest,’ the views to be held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
on anointing with oil, and so on. But it may
be suggested incidentally that the term ‘elder’
is hardly likely to be accepted by either the
Church or the medical profession as applicable
to a person untrained both in theology and in
medicine, whose claim to authority rests on
his own assertion, and whose methods are
only too liable to drift into what is known as
‘quackery.’ Even the Peculiar People, who
rely upon the same text in support of their
tenets, retain, I believe, some meaning of
authority in the word ‘elder’; and their
position seems logically sounder than that of
the believer in a self-styled ‘Spiritual Healer.’</p>

<p>As regards the procedure of the Spiritual
Healer, it would appear to consist in laying
hands on the affected part of the body, at the
same time offering up extempore prayers of a
very impassioned character for the recovery of
the sick. The treatment takes place in as
impressive surroundings as possible, and at
times a priest is called in to anoint the patient
with oil. It is doubtful to what extent the
practitioners of Spiritual Healing claim what
are called ‘special powers’; but it seems
certain that the possession of these powers
is sometimes alleged. Unlike the Christian
Scientist, the Spiritual Healer does not despise
medical assistance, though it is probable that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
at the present time his treatment is sought
chiefly by those to whom medical methods can
offer no further hope of cure.</p>

<p>It has been indicated already that the first
great difficulty experienced by a medical man,
in discussing such a treatment as Spiritual
Healing, is the definition of terms. Accustomed
to deal with more or less concrete facts, a
doctor has some sort of mental picture of
an infectious disease, as the reaction of the
physical body to the invasion of a germ or its
poison; he can see and feel a tumour, and
determine its relation to anatomical structures,
though he may not know as yet the cause of
its growth; he has learnt by experience the
results of the removal of new growths.</p>

<p>In the region of the mind also he has
investigated many phenomena; he is able to
attribute many insane states to toxic influences;
he has studied to some extent diseases
known as ‘functional’&mdash;a class that is
becoming numerically less with the advance
of knowledge; but he is not able to grasp
to the same extent the meaning of the word
‘Spirit.’ The medical man recognises in many
cases the influence of the temperament or
character of the patient upon the course of the
disease, and would prefer to treat one who
takes a hopeful view of the future; just as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
desires quiet cheerful surroundings, and the
avoidance of conditions that tend to irritate
or depress. In so far as the ‘Spiritual’
attitude of the patient conduces to his peace of
mind, its assistance would be welcomed by
every practitioner of the healing art. But to
regard this ill-defined attitude as not only
influencing the character of the patient, but
also as having a direct effect on all the ailments
to which the body is subject, is a view that can
hardly be accepted so readily. For example,
it would seem to be inconceivable that Spirit
could have the slightest influence on a parasitic
skin disease such as ringworm.</p>

<p>This is an instance of a simple ailment due
to a local extrinsic cause. Numerous other
conditions might be mentioned, such as congenital
malformation, aneurysms, valvular
affections of the heart, and strangulated hernia
in which curative influence of the Spirit is
difficult to imagine. Even if a single well-authenticated
miracle in a case of any of these
affections could be produced, we should still
be met by many difficulties; such as the
question why a solitary sufferer, possibly not
highly distinguished for his spiritual attributes,
should be selected for the manifestation of
this power. And all rational people would
admit that the occurrence of such a miracle in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
a case of strangulated hernia would not
justify other patients in postponing operation
in the hope of a repetition of this bloodless
cure.</p>

<p>Thus there are limitations to the field of
operation of Spiritual Healing.</p>

<p>In view, however, of the hopes raised
amongst many good Christians that the Church
may take part once more in healing the sick,
everyone would wish to avoid offending the
susceptibilities of enthusiastic and religious
people. Still it is by members of the Church
that the question of Spiritual Healing has
been brought forward, so that it should be
for the Church to define her meaning and wishes.
In the nature of things it seems impossible to
define ‘Spirit’; and, perhaps, it would be
wiser not to attempt the impossible, nor to
endeavour to yoke spiritual forces to purely
material conditions such as bodily diseases.
But if certain cases are produced as cures by
spiritual means, and if the co-operation of the
medical profession is desired in investigating
such cures, the Church must be prepared to
accept scientific methods of inquiry, methods
which do not permit of assumptions except
as tentative explanations, to be given up
when they fail to explain phenomena, or when
they are replaced by simpler explanations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>If it should appear that the results of
Spiritual Healing are attributable to ordinary
activities of the human mind, and that no
difference exists between cures by this means
and those resulting from ordinary mental
influences of the nature of ‘suggestion,’ then
the Church must be prepared to abandon all
miraculous explanations in these cases. From
the medical point of view the main thing to be
insisted upon is that all alleged cures must
be submitted to the ordinary examination by
observation, experiment, and induction.</p>

<p>At the present time the whole question of
Spiritual Healing is in so nebulous a condition
that it is not easy to obtain suitable cases
for investigation. Much has been said and
written on the matter; comparisons have been
made with the cures said to be effected at
Lourdes; even the Venerable Bede has been
quoted as an authority on medicine. But when
a request is presented for the production of
actual cases for investigation by trained medical
men, it is found that the sources of supply
are few and very limited.</p>

<p>An examination of some of these cases
appears to reveal the fact that so far no actual
cure of any definite gross organic disease can
be recorded. It must be remembered that to
avoid any loophole for error the requirements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
of a really scientific investigation are somewhat
severe. In the first place the diagnosis of the
disease must be absolutely certain. This frequently
necessitates microscopical or bacteriological
examination. A medical man is not
always infallible in his opinion of cases; and
it may happen that a condition that has been
thought to be cancer turns out to be merely a
comparatively harmless inflammatory thickening.
Such a condition might have recovered
by natural processes without any treatment;
to attribute such recovery to any particular
treatment that the patient might be undergoing
at the time would be rash; to use such
a case as an advertisement for that treatment
would be dishonest.</p>

<p>In the second place, a fair comparison must
be made between the results obtained by the
method under investigation, and by other
means of treatment. Warts may disappear
rapidly under many forms of treatment, or
with no treatment at all. To attribute the
disappearance of warts to Spiritual Healing
would be very unsafe argument.</p>

<p>Thirdly, a careful distinction must be drawn
between the cure of a disease and the relief
of subjective symptoms.</p>

<p>It is in this matter of subjective symptoms
that Spiritual Healing appears to have obtained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
the greater part of whatever success it can
boast. There is some evidence that under
this treatment pain may be relieved, and
there is little doubt that patients attain a
calmer, happier and more confident frame of
mind, however hopeless their disease may be.
Their outlook on life is improved, their
thoughts are directed into other channels, and
the pain is forgotten, or hindered from rising
into consciousness.</p>

<p>Yet there are certain dangers connected
with the process, to which attention should be
called. It is well to remember that, in cases
such as incurable cancer, false hopes are being
raised, and the patient is deluded into a vain
belief that he will recover. How far this is
justifiable is a matter for philosophical discussion;
moreover it is true that most doctors
allow their patients to delude themselves
with the same vain hopes. Still, it might be
better that ministers of religion should strive
for the spiritual welfare of their charges,
rather than help directly to maintain these
delusions as to physical conditions.</p>

<p>More important still is the possibility that
treatment, that might be effective in the early
stage of a disease, may be postponed until too
late, in order that a trial may be given to
Spiritual Healing. It is all very well to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
that ordinary medical means are recognised
and that the follies of the Peculiar People and
of the Christian Scientist will be avoided; but
it must be remembered that a literal reading
of the text of St. James undoubtedly may
suggest to a deeply religious person that
medical methods are of minor importance.
‘The Prayer of Faith shall save the Sick’: is
it not possible that the sufferer may possess a
grain of that faith that will remove mountains?
And in the end that small focus of malignant
disease, that might have been eradicated by
the surgeon’s knife, has extended and disseminated
itself until all hope of cure is gone.
And such results are more likely to follow while
this treatment remains in the hands of untrained
laymen. There is great danger that
an earnest person, with limited knowledge
both of theology and of medicine, may come
to regard himself as superior to theologian and
physician, owing to the fervour of his faith,
combined possibly with a belief that he is
endowed with special powers. It is on practical
points such as these that the medical
man is entitled to expect an expression of the
views of the Church; and in this connexion
it is permissible to hope that in the examination
of ‘special powers’ the authorities of the
Church will be content to be sceptics, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
true sense of the word, until irrefutable proofs
of the possession of these powers are produced.</p>

<p>In attempting to inquire how far the
results obtained by Spiritual Healing justify
the movement, the medical man is met by
the difficulty that exists in obtaining evidence.
It is true that there is a Society whose objects
are stated thus:</p>

<p>1. For the cultivation, through spiritual
means, of both personal and corporate health.</p>

<p>2. For the restoration to the Church of the
Scriptural practice of Divine Healing.</p>

<p>3. For the study of the influence of Spiritual
upon Physical well-being.</p>

<p>Investigation of the literature published
by this Society does not throw much light on
the methods by which these objects are pursued.
A pamphlet entitled ‘The Principles of Spiritual
Healing’ seemed to arouse hopes of elucidating
the problem. Yet the author says, ‘I do not
know how “life” is affected by spiritual
means, I observe that it is so.’ There is no
attempt to define spiritual means. Again, it
is asserted that no one will ever find, at
meetings of the Society, a parade of successful
cases. Is the statement, then, of members of
the Society to be the only evidence vouchsafed
to inquirers? And how far is the second
object of the Society to be carried? It must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
be remembered that the Scriptural practice of
Divine Healing was unassociated with the
ordinary medical treatment. In ‘The Principles
of Spiritual Healing’ it is asserted that
miracles of healing did not cease; they have
only become less frequent because faith is less
intense. The second object of the Society
is to restore to the Church this practice of
healing; and it is difficult to see how the
dangers suggested earlier in this article are
to be avoided.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, that it is useless
to attempt to adapt the processes of Spiritual
Healing to recognised forms of treatment, until
the exponents of the method cease to soar on
the wings of the imagination, and descend
instead to the more prosaic levels of reason.
Nevertheless, there is no doubt that theologians
equally earnest, but far more rational than the
founder of the Society to which reference has
been made, are anxious that something should
be done by the Church to assist in the work of
restoring the sick to health. These men do
not aspire to work the miracles of Christ and
the Apostles by laying on hands and anointing
with oil, but they wish to retain for the Church
some portion of the command ‘Preach the
Gospel; heal the sick.’ This wish is entitled
to respectful consideration by the medical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
profession, and most certainly will receive it
from broad-minded medical men. But inasmuch
as the trained physician must be paramount
in his own province of mental and
bodily disease, it is the duty of the minister of
religion to recognise that he is subservient
in purely physical matters of health. By
all means let him visit those of his own faith
who are sick. Let his object be to inspire
these patients with hope, directing the sufferer’s
thoughts away from his disease to higher
things. The laying on of hands and the
anointing with oil may well be dangerous,
unless used in a purely symbolic sense; for
in the minds of the more ignorant such
proceedings tend to occupy the same position
as the treatment for King’s Evil in former
times; and admirable though the spirit of
reverence may be, it is not good to attribute
miraculous powers to the object revered.</p>

<p>Therefore, let the clergyman be content,
for the present, to leave the untrained practice
of methods of suggestion to quacks; and
investigation of so-called cures to the medical
profession. At the same time, let the medical
man avail himself of the services of the
minister of religion in cases in which exhortation
is likely to be of use; for in the field
of functional nervous conditions, and slight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
mental disturbances, the help of a priest of
forceful character, reasonably controlled, may
be of great service.</p>

<p>In concluding this article a summary of the
suggestions offered for consideration may be
made:</p>

<p>(1) The main function of the minister of
religion should be concerned with what is
called the spiritual side of man, and not
with purely material conditions, such as
disease.</p>

<p>(2) If ministers regard the Scriptures as
imposing upon them duties in healing the
sick, they should be content to be subservient
to the physician in material conditions that
are not included in their training.</p>

<p>(3) In dealing with phenomena as specific
as diseases, the Church must be prepared to
accept scientific explanations. It is useless
to complain of the materialism of doctors in
connexion with material physical disorders.</p>

<p>(4) It is not unlikely that the effects of
spiritual healing will prove to be merely results
of a form of suggestion.</p>

<p>(5) Results that can be described as curative
will be found, probably, only in what are
known as functional and neurotic conditions.</p>

<p>(6) It is most unwise to countenance untrained
laymen in carrying on spiritual healing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
in the name of the Church; for in the
end the Church may find herself dragged at
the heels of quackery.</p>

<p>(7) While much can be done by ministers
of religion in encouraging sufferers from disease,
or in distracting the attention of neurasthenics,
and while such assistance should be
welcomed by medical men, yet the Church
should beware of attempting to attract believers
by means of thaumaturgic displays of
healing, which are open to explanation in
other ways. The Church should not enter
into competition with bone-setters, osteopaths,
physical culture quacks, and other undesirable
persons.</p>

<p>(8) Opinion on so-called ‘special powers’
should be suspended until alleged instances
of their existence have been thoroughly investigated
by competent trained experts.</p>

<div class="auth1"><span class="smcap">By Stephen Paget</span>, F.R.C.S.</div>


<p>The Bishop of Birmingham wrote to me, last
year, the following letter. He gave me leave
to publish it in the second edition of a book
of mine about Christian Science: and he
gives me leave to publish it again here:</p>

<p>‘.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I should wish to make a little more of
your admissions as to Mental Therapeutics.
Thus&mdash;If, as you admit, there are so many functional
disorders; and they are curable by mental
influences; and religion is a great mental
influence; and this influence (“Quietism”) is
much needed in such and other cases&mdash;I
should demand of the Church that it should
recognise, far more explicitly, this field of
legitimate curative power, and control it,
and claim it by showing the power to use it.
The neglect of this sphere of influence by the
Church plays into the hands of Christian
Science. (All this could be associated with the
revival of unction.)</p>

<p>‘Also, I think the medical profession likes&mdash;in
public&mdash;to ignore all this, and thus in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
turn plays into the hands of pseudo-theology.
My criticism is that I want your “admissions”
made the basis of a more positive claim both
on the Church and on the medical profession.</p>

<p>‘My own experience in the case of well-to-do
people when sick or dying is that the medical
profession is very much inclined to exclude
religion in any form from sick beds till it
cannot be of any use. I do most seriously
want to reform (1) the Church, (2) the medical
profession, in the light of what you admit.’</p>

<p>This wise letter says all, to my thinking,
that need be said as to the duty of the doctor
towards the cleric, and the duty of the cleric
towards the doctor. It says not a word about
the signs and wonders alleged by the Society
of Emmanuel in London: and I hope that
Dr. Gore, by his silence, condemns them, as not
worthy of credence. I hope, also, and am sure,
that in a few years we shall hear less about
that Society. Meanwhile, I should like to
say something about one aspect of this matter
of ‘spiritual healing,’ which has not received
so much attention as it deserves. We have
heard all about the cleric, all about the doctor:
and we are in danger, I think, of forgetting
the patient. We have been tempted to believe
that the patient, somehow, belongs to the
cleric and the doctor. That we may clear our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
minds of this mistake, let us put ourselves in
the patient’s place. Most of us, I suppose,
know that place: I have been there half a dozen
times. It is the centre of a great planetary
system of kind people. Home love, and the
affection of my friends, and the pleasant
goodwill of the servants, and the wisdom and
the gentleness of doctors and of nurses, and
all prayers for my recovery, wheeled round me,
each in its appointed course. There I lay,
and was watched, like a big baby: and these
activities of the spiritual life encircled me,
day and night, till I got better. The point is,
that it all came naturally to everybody. It
was the habit of the home, it was our usual
way of doing things. My friends did not
suddenly begin to care for me: the doctors
and the nurses did not suddenly begin to be
gentle: the maids were not stung by the splendour
of a sudden thought for my comfort:
the use of prayer on my behalf was nothing
new. Everybody was kind to me, because
everybody in the house always is kind to me.
They made me comfortable, and one prayed
for me, because they are always making me
comfortable, and one daily prays for me.
All of us, except myself, were doing what we
always do: and I was being what I always am.</p>

<p>Illness, nine times out of ten, no more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
changes a man than sleep and exercise change
him. As by a long sleep, or a long day in the
open air, we gain tranquillity, insight, and
self-judgment, so, by an illness, we gain, if
we will, a like measure of self-improvement.
The same good thoughts come to us, as we lie
idle in a sick-bed, which come to us as we
lie idle, in holiday time, on a hillside. An
illness, apart from its drawbacks, is in reality
a sort of holiday, a dull but not unprofitable
vacation, something halfway between a real
holiday and what religious people call a retreat.
There is no sudden change in the patient’s
mind and outlook: only, there is more inlook,
more self-doubt, more quietness of vision.</p>

<p>One day, I shall put myself in the patient’s
place, and not come out of it: I shall not get
well, but die. On that occasion, the love,
sympathy, goodwill, medical attendance, and
prayers, will be the same as before. They
will swing round me once more, each in its
proper sphere, these familiar angels and ministers
of grace defending me. But, as I begin
to stop, so they will begin to stop. It
will become absurd, for my friends to call
and ask after me; absurd, for the household
to devise plans for my comfort; absurd, for
the doctors to try to feel what is left of my
pulse; absurd, for anybody to pray for my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
recovery. Spiritual processes are blessed with
plenty of common-sense: they leave off,
when it becomes downright foolishness to go
on. Let them leave what remains of me, and
start again round another centre.</p>

<p>They who desire, extravagantly, to put
‘spiritual healing’ among the methods of the
Christian ministry, seem to me to be losing
sight of this fact, that common-sense is an
essential part of the spiritual life. Common-sense
tells me, that as I was intended to live,
so I am intended to die. I cannot see any
reason, human or divine, why I should live to
old age, and die of that. I would rather not:
anyhow, I see no reason why I should. God,
who brought me into the world by my
mother’s pain, will some day put me out of the
world, by my own pain. He is in no sense
more on the side of life than on the side of
death. I have been looking at the ‘Order
for the Visitation of the Sick’ in the Prayer-book
and I am quite sure that nobody now
could write anything half so sensible or so
majestical.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>Know this, that Almighty God
is the Lord of life and death, and of all things
to them pertaining, as youth, strength, health,
age, weakness, and sickness. Wherefore, whatsoever
your sickness is, know you certainly,
that it is God’s visitation.</i> And the prayer for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
a sick child, also, seems to me a very sensible
and beautiful piece of writing. I find, also,
a prayer for a sick person, ‘when there
appeareth small hope of recovery.’ I have
heard it read over one at the point of death,
when there was no hope at all of recovery.
‘We know,’ it says, ‘that, if Thou wilt, Thou
canst even yet raise him up.’ I hope that
I shall not, when I am dying, hear this phrase.
It rings false, to my thinking: it offends the
natural dignity of a dying man. We doctors
are blamed, now and again, for not telling the
truth to patients hopelessly ill: but here is
the Prayer-book, at the last moment, hardly
more straightforward. All the same, this Order
for the Visitation of the Sick is admirable; and I
desire to contrast it with the following instance,
how Christian Science treats the dying:</p>

<p>‘Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; is a widow, and an old friend of
mine. In February 1905, her only child, a boy
of eleven, was in the last stage of a hopeless
illness&mdash;mitral valvular heart disease, with
rheumatism and dropsy. I had an opportunity
of a few minutes’ talk with the Christian
Science “practitioner”&mdash;a sweet, gentle, earnest
woman&mdash;and asked her if she really thought
she would do any good. “Oh yes,” she replied,
with a smile of confidence; “I have never
known a failure.” “But,” I suggested, “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
boy is very seriously ill:” and I explained the
nature of his complaint. Still confidently
smiling, the practitioner replied, “We have had
worse cases than this.” I told her the best
medical advice had been taken, and the
doctors had all given the boy up. Upon which
the lady remarked, with gentle emphasis,
“<i>God</i> has not given him up.” That of course
was conclusive, and I left her to do her best.
I went away at ten o’clock, and then the
Scientist seated herself by the patient, read
to him from the Bible and Mrs. Eddy’s book,
and exhorted him in some such language as
this: “You must not think you are ill, my
dear little boy. You are <i>not</i> ill: you <i>can’t</i>
be ill. God would not make you ill. He
made all things good, but not illness”&mdash;and so
on, and so on. The boy, I am told, heard her
patiently but wearily, and at one-thirty he
died. Then the practitioner gathered up her
books and papers and went away, and that is
the end of the story.’</p>

<p>Here we have Christian Science in a favourable
light: all the same, it is not a pleasant
picture, these falsehoods told to a dying child.
If it be not true that God ‘makes illness,’
and if it be not true that God ‘gives us up,’
then I attach no meaning at all to that Name.</p>

<p>Let us put ourselves at that point of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
case where there appeareth small hope of
recovery. The doctors have given the patient
up. God, in their opinion, has done the same.
The cleric will not say that, not in so many
words: <i>Yet</i>, he says, <i>forasmuch as in all
appearance the time of his dissolution draweth
near, so fit and prepare him, we beseech Thee,
against the hour of death, that after his departure
hence in peace, and in Thy favour, his soul
may be received into Thine everlasting Kingdom</i>.
The cleric does not pray for the patient’s
recovery. He does not expect anything to
happen, save the patient’s death. He will not
point-blank deny the possibility of a miracle:
but he neither asks for anything to happen, nor,
so far as I can see, wants anything to happen:
he only cares to be sure that the patient, who
is fast going, shall go the right way.</p>

<p>It is here, on this edge of time between
life and death, that the professional spiritual
healer loves to perform. He desires to make
something happen: he will not take it for
granted that nothing will happen.</p>

<p>His position is logical, and may be held in
absolute sincerity. Only, he is bound to tell
us what, in his experience, does happen: and
he is bound to tell us of every case of failure, or
partial failure. And we are bound to examine,
test, cross-examine, criticise, analyse, watch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
and almost spy upon every scrap of his work;
and that in a spirit of hard and well-nigh brutal
indifference to his belief in himself as a channel
of divine intervention. What else does he
expect of us? What else are we here for?</p>

<p>Among a pile of letters and pamphlets on
my table is a tract called ‘New Eyes in answer
to Prayer.’ It gives the case of Mr. Evison,
of Grimsby. He had something the matter
with his eyes. At last, ‘while walking out
with a friend one day, I put my hand in my
pocket for something, and dropped it on the
ground: on stooping down to pick it up, the
remaining pieces of my eyes dropped out of
their sockets on to the ground. They were
about the size of the kernel of a nut.’ So
he went to a ‘Divine Healing Home,’ where
he was anointed with oil in the name of the
Lord. Ten days later, as he was praying in
his bedroom, he felt two warm fingers touch
his empty sockets, and they became warm.
Later, at a prayer meeting, his eyes ‘came
wide open,’ and he saw perfectly. Next day
he testified to his recovery; and, says the
tract, ‘When this testimony was given by
Mr. Evison, there were fifty-seven cases of
blindness restored in answer to prayer.’</p>

<p>I feel sure that the writer of this tract
thought that he was telling the truth. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
I am no less sure that a great deal of ‘spiritual
healing’ is just as worthless, just as untrue,
as these Grimsby miracles. Till the alleged
wonders of spiritual healing, and its unpublished
failures, have been all submitted to
keen scrutiny, and to every severest and most
searching test that can be devised in science,
nobody who knows anything about pathology
can take much interest in them. So I come back
to the Bishop of Birmingham’s wise eirenicon.</p>

<p>It is a great pity that the work of the
cleric and the work of the doctor should ever
clash; for they are ordained (the Prayer-book
again) for the mutual society, help, and comfort
that the one ought to have of the other.
Only, if they are to be friends in ministering
to the sick and the dying, they must be friends
always. If, in social life, they do not get on
well together, they will not work together
well in the sick-room. If the doctor makes
stupid jokes against religion, and the cleric
doses his parishioners with quack medicines;
if the doctor is dull to the wonders of faith, and
the cleric is dull to the wonders of science:
if neither has the grace to recognise and honour
and openly praise the good works of the
other&mdash;how shall they adjust themselves, in
the presence of impending death, who thus
waste the opportunities of daily life?</p>

<p>In considering the subject of Religion and
Medicine, we shall be helped by looking back
to the beginnings of things, when people first
realised that illnesses existed, and that certain
of them were curable. They knew nothing of
internal anatomy or physiology, nothing of
the origin and treatment of disease, nothing
of its infectious, communicable character.
The treatment, or, at any rate, the healing of
disease, must have been by means of what
seemed to be mental influences in those
early ages. Why, our very word ‘Influenza,’
revived within comparatively recent years,
shows how vaguely and imperfectly was understood
a disease which now we recognise as
having a definite train of symptoms, but of
which we still know so little that we speak
of it merely as an <i>influence</i>.</p>

<p>The idea of mental influence in disease was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
first scientifically formulated about twenty-five
years ago, and was provided with one of
those queer names which we now use more or
less glibly, with a sort of comforting feeling
that we understand the subject, when we
have successfully mastered the spelling and
pronunciation&mdash;the scientific name <i>psychotherapeutics</i>,
or, in plain English, <i>mind cure</i>.
These investigations were undertaken in
France, to start with, at Nancy University,
by Liébault, who published, in 1866, ‘Treatment
by Suggestion,’ and by Bernheim, and
simultaneously in Paris by Charcot, and they
were primarily to observe sundry methods
of treatment used at that time in an unscientific
manner, such as animal magnetism,
mesmerism, hypnotism, &amp;c. Liébault’s book,
which was taken little notice of at the time,
gave a full description of the methods he
pursued, which more or less coincide with those
followed by doctors who practise Treatment
by Suggestion and Hypnotism at the present
day. He lived a retired life, and practised
entirely amongst the poor, who were devoted
to him, but, at the same time, regarded him
as an amiable enthusiast. Liébault finally
retired on a very small competency, not
acquired from his practice, which was altogether
unremunerative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p>As a result of this gathering up of all these
so-called occult methods of treatment into
the more or less exact science of Psychotherapeutics,
have come into prominence many
cults&mdash;or sects, shall we call them?&mdash;such as
Mental Healing, Faith Cures, Peculiar People,
Metaphysical Healing, Christian Science, each
of which is overlaid with doctrines of a more
or less dubious kind. The growth of these
various bodies of late years has been extraordinarily
rapid: to mention two of them
only, Christian Science and New Thought
are now enthusiastically practised and believed
in by many thousands of people, both here
and in America, and hundreds of churches
have been provided and erected in their
names.</p>

<p>It must not be lost sight of that Christian
Science, as well as New Thought, which has
been described by Mr. Dresser, one of its
chief exponents, as being ‘a common-sense,
rational phase of the Mental Healing Doctrine,’
‘are dealing with genuine <i>facts</i> in the sphere
of Mental Therapeutics’; but these facts are
entirely independent of the theories by which
either school attempts to explain them.</p>

<p>The spread of Christian Science was viewed
with considerable alarm by many influential
members and dignitaries of our own Church,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
and this feeling was brought to a head at the
Pan-Anglican Congress in 1908, when a large
meeting on the subject was held at the Albert
Hall, which is fully reported in the handbook
of the Pan-Anglican Congress.</p>

<p>Following on the Pan-Anglican Congress
meeting came the Pronouncement of the
Bishops assembled in Conference at Lambeth,
in July 1908. The report of this Conference
is published by the S.P.C.K. as a pamphlet.
On November 16, 1908, an important conference
on Spiritual Healing was held at Sion
College, which was presided over by Prebendary
Pennefather, who said that the Church had
too long neglected that part of her teaching
and ministry. Mr. Hickson gave an account
of the Society of Emmanuel, and stated that
they desired to revive in the Church the use
of the gift of healing committed to her by
our Lord.</p>

<p>The Rev. Francis Boyd explained the
objects and work of the Guild of Health.
They held that bodily healing was not of
primary importance, that sanctification might
indeed be gained through sickness, but that
a fuller sanctification might be gained by
those who sought to be made whole by a more
real and vital union with our Lord. The
Guild of Health, Mr. Boyd proceeded to say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
recognised three systems of healing&mdash;physical,
mental, and spiritual&mdash;though there was not
necessarily any opposition between them.
They felt, however, that Spiritual Healing
was the only system which concerned the
Church. They were quite alive to the dangers
of over-estimating the value of bodily health,
and only desired to further it so far as it
ministered to the perfection of the whole
nature of man. After some further discussion,
a resolution was passed that, ‘In the
opinion of this Conference, the time has come
to form a Central Church Council in the
diocese of London, for the consideration of
questions connected with Healing by Spiritual
means.’</p>

<p>At the outset, we must take exception to
Mr. Boyd’s three systems. I very much
question whether there is more than <i>one</i>
system, and I am convinced that physical
and mental are one and the same. And
I would go so far as to say, that the disastrous
mistakes that have been made in the past, and
which are still in operation to-day in the
treatment of one large section of sick people,
viz. the insane, largely owe their origin to this
arbitrary division. And, by a curious irony,
the branch of medical science where there is
the most marked predominance of materialism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
is this very department of mental diseases.
This is all the more curious when we reflect,
what occult influences have been, in all ages,
supposed to work upon the insane. The
obnoxious word ‘lunatic’ is a proof of this.
The moon was by some supposed to have a
deleterious effect on the intellect; insane
persons were spoken of as ‘moonstruck’;
the periodicity of the mental attacks was also
supposed to have some relation to the lunar
interval. Indeed, the whole subject of insanity
bristles with occult and mysterious theories.
The really hopeful treatment of insanity began
when it&mdash;a mental disease&mdash;was treated, not
by mental, but by physical methods, and the
more mental and physical are taken together
as one and the same, the more rational and
productive of good, in the best sense, is our
treatment likely to be. Indeed, the whole
indivisibility of the three systems is nowhere
so well shown as in the arbitrary division of
Religious Insanity. Surely if we try to turn the
minds of the sufferers from any considerations
of religion, by removing their Bibles, by preventing
them from any religious discussion, or
from taking part in any religious ceremonies,
we are helping to keep up the evil. People,
as we put it, become insane on religious matters,
not only because they have been dwelling on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
the subject unduly, but because it is naturally
of the greatest importance, and absorbs more
attention than probably anything else in the
world. Now, as the more purely physical, as distinguished
from the more or less occult methods
of regarding the insane, has become the more
enlightened and modern view of the subject, so
has the spiritual method of dealing with it
come into prominence. Spiritual ministrations
to the insane may be thought to be useless,
or, at any rate, to be fraught with little practical
utility. Comparatively recently a man who
had charge of a country parish was appointed
chaplain to Broadmoor, which is the asylum
for insane criminals. A friend, on being told of
the appointment, said to him, ‘Why, whatever
will you say to them? You can only talk to
them of their sins.’ ‘Talk to them of their
sins!’ he said; ‘I shall never mention them<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span>
I shall talk to them of Hope.’</p>

<p>I have thought it advisable to dwell rather
at length on the question of the insane, because
it really rather fairly represents my point of
view on this subject. Whether you agree
with me or not, it is better that I should
state quite fairly and straightly my position,
which has only been reached by honestly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
striving after truth, and by looking fully into
the subject for the purposes of this paper.
In talking about Spiritual Healing, we are
hampered at the start, because we have only
actual knowledge of physical things, i.e. of
things as they appear to us here. We have
to define spiritual things in physical terms,
because they are the only things we know
and understand. Time and space do not
exist in the spiritual domain. Take just one
word in illustration of my meaning, the word
<i>Rest</i>. Our present state of being here has
certain peculiarities. Labour involves rest
from labour, and if the limits of rest and
labour are exceeded, the result is ruin to
man’s moral and physical being. Disease is
sure to follow the inactive mind or body, and
then comes a time when ‘we cannot do the
things we would.’ But these things do not
exist in spiritual language. ‘They rest not
day and night, but cry “Holy, Holy, Holy.”&#8202;’
When we pray ‘Eternal rest grant them, O
Lord,’ we have no thought of a period of rest
as we understand it, but rest in and with
God.</p>

<p>We are far too apt to think that suffering is
an evil&mdash;it is not necessarily so; on the contrary
it may be a blessing, because it is often a direct
means of advance towards perfection. Far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
too much attention is paid at the present
day to temporal benefits. ‘Get rid of poverty,
of suffering, and the world will be virtuous
and happy,’ but this is not so. The people who
starve and brutally ill-use their children are
not the very poorest; they are usually well-to-do
in the world. There is a great deal too
much of considering poverty as a <i>real</i> cause
of suffering. Christ’s mission of redemption
was not primarily a mission for the relief of
suffering. If He bids us to take up our cross,
He also bids us, as a quite essential corollary,
to follow Him. Indeed, taking up our cross
is useless, if we do not follow Him. Pain, far
from being shunned, should be welcomed and
embraced, because it brings us nearer to the
sufferings of our Blessed Lord. It is not, of
course, mere pain in itself that lifts and
cleanses: it is pain rightly and courageously
borne, from whatever motive. If this be true,
the modern revolt against all suffering&mdash;and
here I quote from the late Miss Caroline
Stephens’s article on ‘Pain,’ published in the
<i>Hibbert Journal</i> for October 1908&mdash;‘is obviously
suicidal. To extinguish all suffering, were that
possible, would be to deprive the world of a
leverage as all-pervading and effectual towards
spiritual elevation and purification, as is
gravitation towards stability.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p>Pain and evil are not interchangeable
terms, but are quite different. Evil cannot be
innocent, though pain can be, and often is.
When the disciples said, ‘What hath this man
or his parents done that he should be born
blind?’ they formulated the usually accepted
idea at that time, and an idea, moreover, that
dies very hard. The whole treatment of
disease in the Middle Ages was based on it.</p>

<p>If we quite briefly consider our Lord’s
miracles, they were <i>signs</i> of His Divine mission,
not proofs, and in performing them, He felt
limitations; for we are definitely told that
in Capernaum ‘He did no more mighty
works, because of their unbelief.’ These signs
were sudden manifestations of His power,
and as such they are preferably called Divine
Healing. They showed the very highest degree
of spiritual power, but there was nothing
really new. Christ was the perfect manifestation
of eternal things, and eternal things
are obviously never new. Perhaps the fact
that our Lord thought it worth while to show
his power in bodily healing was intended
to teach us that to keep our bodies in health
is an important religious duty, and more than
that, that all hygienic social work undertaken
is an important part of the duties of religion.
Both nursing and doctoring bring us very near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
to part of the work of Christ, for He went
about doing good to the sick, and He symbolised
this, not only by His healing words,
but by the simple medicines and nursing of
the Good Samaritan. But just as illness is
by no means caused by evil or ill-doing, so it
is equally clear that goodness does not of
necessity bring health. The question of bodily
health has no connexion with spiritual conceptions
at all. If it were so, the persons who
are the strongest physically would be the
most spiritual; but we know, of course, that
this is not so. Take St. Catherine of Siena,
one of the greatest of saints, statesmen, and
scholars that the world has ever known. She
healed others, but she died herself of a lingering,
painful disease, at the early age of thirty-three.
Also St. Paul, who prayed the Lord thrice
that the thorn in the flesh which tormented
him might be removed. And the Lord’s reply
has been a help and comfort, and a lesson
to countless thousands ever since. ‘My grace
is sufficient for thee, for My power is made
perfect through weakness.’ And what we
so very often see now, persons bereft of all
that makes life dear, in suffering of mind or
body maybe, yet rise above their weakness,
and carry through such reforms and such
noble acts as they never could have done had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
they been allowed to remain in bodily health
and comfortable and happy surroundings.
Indeed, St. Paul’s affliction was the means of
his converting the Galatians, for his illness
compelled him to stop with them for a time,
and in writing to the Corinthians from them,
he could truly say, ‘Most gladly, therefore,
will I rather glory in my weaknesses that the
strength of Christ may cover me.’ To repeat,
it is our duty, as far as can be, to keep our
bodies in health, though we can most of us
conceive of circumstances when to lose our
life may be indeed to save it.</p>

<p>In a sermon preached for the ‘Guild of Poor
Brave Things,’ the present Bishop of London,
who is the president of the Guild, said: ‘What
made more impression on me as an undergraduate
at Oxford than all the sermons I ever
heard in chapel was a young don, insisting, at
the risk of his life, on ministering to an undergraduate
dying of a most infectious disease.’</p>

<p>After all, St. Paul’s life, as narrated by
himself, can hardly have been considered as
hygienic. ‘Of the Jews five times received
I forty stripes save one. Thrice was I beaten
with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered
shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the
deep; in journeyings often, in perils of rivers,
in perils of robbers, in perils of my own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
countrymen, in perils from the Gentiles, in
perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness,
in perils in the sea, in perils amongst false
brethren; in labour and travail, in watchings
often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often,
in cold and nakedness. Besides those things
that are without, there is that which presseth
upon me daily, anxiety for all the churches.’
In comparison with this, the ‘Don’t-worry
Gospel’ of the Christian Scientists seems utterly
beside the mark. Health is undoubtedly good,
but it must sometimes be cast away in the
service of others.</p>

<p>Of course there is a philosophical difficulty
in the whole position of the relation of religion
to medicine. In a manner they are, as it
were, at loggerheads from the outset. The
Church is bound to teach that it matters not
how long or how short a man’s life is, if it is
rightly spent, whereas the doctor’s point of
view must be to keep the man alive at any
price. And although we may feel that, under
certain circumstances, the medical attitude
might be modified, it is the only safe one in the
present state of our knowledge. Euthanasia
seems, on the surface, a most humane and
comforting suggestion, but it is allowing us
finite beings to take into our own hands things
which are beyond our comprehension. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
all know of instances where it must have been
thought that death would be preferable to
life; but apart from the presumptuous thought
of mere human beings, look how often the
maimed bodily frame ‘rises on stepping stones
of its dead self to higher things.’ A man struck
with blindness, for example, may be living a full
and perfect and whole life, in spite of his
maimed condition, because he puts out all
his powers and lives at the top of his bent.
Such a man is in the highest state a healthy
being. The unwhole man is one who is always
in terror of his life, and who does not accept
with faith and cheerfulness, and in a life of
prayer, the ills that are laid upon him by a
wise and Divine Providence. It is true that
there are more things wrought by prayer than
this world dreams of. Yes, but even our
prayers have necessary limitations arising from
our imperfect knowledge, and when St. James
declared that the prayer of faith shall save
the sick, he spoke at a time when scientific
investigation was non-existent, and when people
must have been sorely distressed by their
total inability to overcome the diseases from
which those around them were suffering.
But for us, whose physical knowledge is so
much more exact, to refuse to accept the
remedies which hard and patient toil has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
discovered, under God’s help and guidance
(there whether we recognise it or not), is both
presumptuous and foolish. Spiritual Healing&mdash;i.e.
a quasi-miraculous process&mdash;<i>must</i> die a
natural death, even if the agony is prolonged.
It is simply pandering to charlatanism, and
by its exaltation of the Health of the Body,
is almost pagan in its effects. It is, moreover,
an emphatic expression of individualism at a
time when co-operation in every direction is
the natural and right trend of affairs; for
truly never did we feel so strongly as now, that
no man liveth to himself, and no man dieth to
himself&mdash;as true of nations as of individuals.
It is, therefore, in the highest sense, reactionary,
and a sentimental attempt to put the clock
back, which is doomed to failure. Take one
item, which is wrapped up in this idea of
Spiritual Healing, and that is Demoniac Possession.
This was an ancient belief, as is shown
by some of the miracles narrated in the Gospels,
and there is an attempt to revive it in the
present day, and with that, a practice of
Exorcism as a cure for it. ‘But,’ and here
I quote from ‘Religion and Medicine,’ ‘it is
a significant fact that as education spreads,
belief in demoniac possession dies out, and
the greatest strongholds of the belief to-day
are in non-Christian countries.’ A possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
explanation of this is, that in Christian
countries, spiritual forces have been actively
at work for many generations, and that this
spiritual activity has weakened the power of
the forces of evil. There is, too, no blinking
the question that the behaviour of insane
people, or even of people supposed to be insane,
might be explained on the theory of demoniac
possession. For example, how often one sees
people generally good and kind, and even truly
religious, go suddenly into a fury of temper
or violence of some kind; or in delirium we
know that quite sweet, innocent people say
dreadful things which one would think they
could not even <i>know</i>. No doubt to some
people the temporary possession by some evil
spirit is a more comfortable theory than that
it is a revelation of the natural man in us,
when discipline and training are in some way
relaxed, and that such is our <i>real</i> nature let loose.</p>

<p>The dangers of a belief in, and of practising
<i>consciously</i>, Spiritual Healing are great, as far
as doctors are concerned. It simply puts a
premium on ignorance and laziness, and is
disastrous to exact knowledge and scientific
investigation. Spiritual healers assert that
to dwell on the abnormal and pathological
prevents their work on the normal. But who
is to say what is the normal, till abnormalities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
have been weighed and considered? No, to
people like myself who practise medicine, it
is a dangerous and uncertain weapon to
employ. Far be it from me to say that the
spiritual side of medicine should be ignored
altogether. We know that our prayers, rightly
offered, are a help to our patients&mdash;we
<i>know</i> that the ordained Sacraments of the
Church are a help to them. Moreover, we
know very well that there is no royal road to
the treatment of disease. We know well how
many cases there are in our various hospitals
and infirmaries, that have baffled all the skill
of diagnosis and treatment that has been
vouched to the world up to the present time.
Is it rational to believe that such cases will
be healed by a glance, or a touch, or a word
of any merely human person, however holy,
who is manifestly ignorant of any ordinary
scientific knowledge? No, Spiritual Healing
as a cult, as a part of the sacramental life of
the Church, will cease to exist, but all that
has come out of it will be quickened and
strengthened. We shall feel greater need of
prayer and intercession, and we shall feel
more and more the real value of meditation.</p>

<p>That the medical profession is fully alive
to the importance of the question, in spite
of its difficulties, may be inferred from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
following extract from the <i>British Medical
Journal</i>, November 6, 1909:</p>

<p>‘We welcome the discussion at the Harveian
Society, as a sign that the profession is more
fully realising the value of certain potentialities
of healing and relief, which an ingrained
materialism passes by on one side. All around
us spiritual or mental healing is going on. It
is our duty, as it is our interest, to study the
process scientifically, to define its limitations
both in regard to the conditions to which it is
applicable and to the persons who can successfully
apply it, and to recognise perhaps more
fully than before that man is a compound of
body and spirit, both of which have to be
taken into account by those who undertake
the treatment of disease. The first step to be
taken, if the profession is not to surrender a
large part of its sphere of usefulness, is that
medical practitioners should be trained in
psychology as well as in physiology. In saying
this we do not wish to be understood as pinning
our faith entirely to experimental psychology.
A careful study of the works of the great
masters of the human heart is at least as
important as the estimate of time reactions
and the accuracy of visual impressions.’ ‘A
careful study of the works of the great masters
of the human heart’&mdash;this rings true, and makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
one hopeful, in spite of the confusion in terms
that exist in regard to Psychic Healing and
Spiritual Healing.</p>

<p>Spiritual Healing may be defined as a
change in a person’s point of view. It may
be a question of building up character, or of
development of spiritual attributes. In both
cases, it is essentially a matter of instruction.
And the teaching will be effective in proportion
as the teacher is possessed of sincerity and
sympathy. I am anxious to be most emphatic
in saying this, because so much misunderstanding
has arisen of late on all sides, owing
to misconceptions on this point. Spiritual
Healing can only, in quite a secondary way, be
a physical process. Again, take the case of a
man who becomes blind in a way that prohibits
any idea of his ever recovering his sight;
he may develop into a miserable, discontented
being on account of his affliction. He comes
under the influence of some teaching, of some
person, or of some sudden religious inspiration.
He is healed. Can he see again? No, but
he has risen superior to his blindness. He
is a <i>whole</i> man once more. This is all that he
and his lay friends know. He <i>may</i> even
enjoy better physical health than he did while
his blindness oppressed him. Or, again, there
may be morbid physical conditions directly or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
indirectly attributable to a morbid temperament,
sleeplessness due to wrongdoing, or
chronic dyspepsia due to worry. In such cases
as these, the doctor may do little or nothing.
The malady is only incidentally a physical one.
Here ‘Spiritual Healing’ in the true sense is the
only remedy, and every liberal-minded medical
practitioner would desire it for the patient.</p>

<p>Practically, as I have repeatedly found
from experience, priest and doctor can combine
to the great advantage of the patient. Medical
practitioners need have no fear that, with
wise and experienced priests, they will find
their special province interfered with; on the
contrary, their hands will be strengthened,
the patients calmed, and their fortitude increased.
It has been my lot many times to
find the irritable patient resentful of her
illness, and of God’s dealing with her, brought
to a calm, hopeful, restful frame of mind, and
that by the ministrations and prayers of a
wise and tactful priest.</p>

<p>Perhaps St. Catherine of Siena expresses
what is meant by all this in speaking of
praying for others. ‘It is toil for him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to
hold him in the presence of God.’ And it is
here that the priest can so greatly assist us in
our labours on behalf of those weak or sick ones
who have been entrusted to our care.</p>

<div class="auth2"><span class="smcap">By Theo. B. Hyslop</span>, M.D.</div>


<h3><i>The Tendency for Insanity to increase on
Account of the Stress of Life.</i></h3>

<p>That there is a tendency for insanity to
increase on account of the stress of competition
and all the complexities of modern civilisation
few will deny. The burden of taxation upon
the nerve tissues and the drain upon their
stores of energy must necessarily go on increasing
as the uses for the physical mechanism
of the body and limbs diminish and become
replaced by the more complex nervous activities
essential to brain and mental avocations.
The influences of rural and urban life, trades
and occupations, &amp;c., as favouring the occurrence
of insanity, have been dealt with in an
exhaustive manner in various reports, treatises,
and innumerable papers, and the result has
been to apprise us of the fact that the percentage
of individuals who are incapable by
reason of mental perversion or defect from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
taking active and useful parts as citizens far
exceeds our previous conceptions as to the
extent of the degeneration in our midst.</p>

<p>It is well-nigh impossible to obtain a
complete census of the physical and mental
states of the people. Statistics furnish us
with so many fallacies that for present purposes
I prefer to omit them, and deal only with
broad issues which seem to have direct bearings
upon the mental health of the community.</p>

<p>It is now an accepted fact that civilisation,
with its tendencies towards the aggregation of
individuals into dense communities, favours
the occurrence in those communities of overcrowding,
pauperism, crime, and degeneration.
For those designed by habit and heredity to
rural life, migration to cities where the struggle
for life is continued under totally different
circumstances is disastrous, and for them
the step from country to town is but one of
the commonest of all the steps towards
mental and physical deterioration, the accidents
of civilisation finding in them merely the
readiest victims.</p>

<p>The necessity of this migration, as determined
by the state of agriculture, makes it
none the less an evil, and it is a symptom in
the evolution of an essentially agricultural
race which is fraught with extreme danger to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
the maintenance of its nervous and mental
stability.</p>

<p>The problem, however, has a different
aspect for those who by habit and heredity
are trained for city life, and certain it is that
increased facilities for travelling are tending
to decentralise our cities and thereby render
the city dwellers healthier and more fit to
cope with the drain upon their nervous
energies. As a physician, it would appear to
the writer that the problem of Sunday observances
in town and country have different
bearings on the health and physical fitness of
the people. There is no doubt that periodic
decentralisation of town dwellers is essential
to the maintenance of bodily health, and it is
also true that physical exercise and change
from mental to physical functioning and
<i>vice versa</i> is essential to all&mdash;i.e. if the balance
between the mental and physical powers is
to be adequately maintained. It is, of course,
to be understood that to a physician the
preservation of this balance is his first care,
and to him is entrusted the function of aiding
in the proper observance of all that is
in agreement with biological and, therefore,
natural laws. To him there is a great difference
between ‘observance’ and ‘belief’; and
he sees in them either mutually co-operative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
or mutually destructive factors for good or
ill respectively.</p>

<p>If religious observances, under determined
conditions, are found to be useful and essential
for the sane in mind and body, they are also
likely to be so, under conditions otherwise
determined and arranged, for the insane. Many
insane patients are totally incapable of attending
any religious function. Some must be
prohibited; others may be encouraged. As
an asylum physician the writer may state that
a generic case of religious excitement or
enthusiasm may most advisedly even be restrained
from religious functions until at
least the acute symptoms have subsided.
There can be little doubt that no religious
officer would be likely to succeed in accomplishing
much for patients without an accurate
knowledge of insanity and the mental experiences
of those whom he seeks to influence.
The fact that mental aberration forms a
special study and phase of life increases his
difficulties and limits his possibilities. Where
there is apparent failure both inside asylums
and without, such failures may very possibly
be attributed to the deficiencies of the doctrine,
the discipline of the religion itself, the organisations
peculiar to it, or the functionaries
associated with it in our day. If the Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
religion is a true philosophy, it is the duty
of all who profess Christianity to assist in the
practical application of its precepts, where such
can be judiciously and safely applied, taking
religious things perforce as they find them,
and utilising their own special knowledge to
the best possible advantage, according to the
conditions they find.</p>

<p>Is a person with deep religious conviction
better equipped to face the stress of life than
an unbeliever? An answer to this question
was given by the writer in a paper read at
the annual meeting of the British Medical
Association held at Leicester in 1905. In
stating that ‘a true and philosophical
religion raises the mind above a mere
incidental emotionalism’ he used the word
‘religion’ in its literal sense, as derived from
<i>re</i> and <i>lego</i>, to gather and consider, as opposed
to <i>negligens</i>. He in no way extended its
connotation so as to include demonstrations
of incidental emotionalism, superstition, or
fanaticism. Religion and moral obligation he
considered to be almost convertible terms,
both equally compatible with intuitionalism,
utilitarianism, or any other ‘ism’ derived
from the study of the laws of life and mind.
Moral laws are generally principles of thought
and action, which an intelligent being must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
apply for himself in the guidance of his conduct,
and the translation of such general principles
(expressed either in general abstract form or
in the form of a command) into particular
actions. Conformity with such precepts
of morality may with reason be regarded
as a safeguard against the ‘lusts of the
flesh.’</p>

<p>Religious enthusiasm in itself cannot
justly be termed an evil. Rather does it
embody the most healthy and preservative
development of our social forces. Like many
other tendencies of the mind, it is subject
to exaggeration, misapplication, and a predominance
of the emotions over the intellect.
The typical cases of religious insanity directly
developable from sectarian and even undenominational
religious enthusiasm, from
religious meditations, exercises, devotions, or
superstitions, are by no means so common as
they are supposed to be by the uninitiated
observer. The true point lies in this, that
very many mental cases bear a strongly
marked religious or at least moral aspect. The
psychology of the subject will show, for example,
that acute depression&mdash;a predominant
phase of abnormal emotional life&mdash;leads
almost necessarily to a religious interpretation.
And this is even more the case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
with many actual sense perversions. Such,
I mean, as have ever been associated with the
ideas of the supernatural.</p>

<p>These are not necessarily caused by religious
over-excitement or enthusiasm. They may
assume the appearance of it, because, being
the deepest and most real feelings, desires,
and convictions of the perverted organic life
or of the moral reaction which accompanies
it, they cannot well be expressed or described
except in strong moral terms. Over and over
again does this appear, and often among those
least likely to be suspected of any religious
predisposition. That these feelings should be
clothed according to the prevailing ideas and
creed of the patient is an essential reproduction
of the mind. But, after all, this only relates to
the form of their appearance, and there are
many things which lie deeper.</p>

<p>Religious excitement is not infrequently
assigned as a cause of insanity. The writer
has stated elsewhere his belief that the philosophy
of the infinite, far from being a source
of aberrations of thought which may be deemed
insane, is the ultimate point of our mental
evolution, and that a true and philosophical
religion raises the mind above a mere incidental
emotionalism and gives stability. With no
religion and no moral obligation the organism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
is apt to become a prey to the lusts of the flesh
and their consequences. Gasquet observes
that religion may either produce or tend to
hinder unsoundness of mind; that it may
cause certain symptoms of insanity or modify
them; and, lastly, that it may be employed
as a means of moral prevention and treatment.
He believes that every form of religion,
however widely it may differ from our standard
of the truth, if it enforces the precepts of
morality, is a source of strength to the sound
mind that sincerely accepts it.</p>

<p>Clouston has justly observed that far
more depends upon the brain that goes to
church than upon what it may obtain in the
church. That is to say, there must be the
predisposition to break down, the religious
influence being often merely an accident.
It must also be remembered that religious
over-enthusiasm may be merely a symptom
and not a cause.</p>

<p>Much misconception through misquotation
has arisen in connexion with the writer’s
views as to the therapeutic value of prayer.
Reference to the context of his views expressed
before the Society for the Study of Childhood
will show that reference was made to the <i>habit</i>
of prayer in childhood, and its therapeutic
value was there urged more as a preventive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
than as a curative agent. It was urged that
the mental hygiene of childhood was not to
be determined by any special denominational
method.</p>

<p>Such limited methods may result in the
fixity of an idea or belief quite compatible
with usefulness in any sphere of activity, but
they do not deal with the broader and deeper
question of the preservation of the mental
health of the individual. The exaggerated importance
of the denominational question, which
has engendered passive resistance, ought to give
way to the question of mental health and
engender a strong and active resistance to
all that tends to narrow or circumscribe the
mental life of the infant. It ought to be our
object as teachers and physicians to fight
against all those influences which tend to
produce either religious indifference or intemperance,
and to subscribe as best we may to
that form of religious belief, so far as we can
find it practically embodied or effective, which
believes in ‘the larger hope,’ though it
condemns unreservedly the demonstrable superstition
and sentimentality which impede its
progress and power. As an alienist, and as
one whose whole life has been concerned
with the sufferings of the human mind,
the writer believes that of all the hygienic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
measures to counteract disturbed sleep,
depression of spirits, and all the miserable
sequelæ of a distrait mind, he would undoubtedly
give the first place to the simple
<i>habit</i> of prayer. Let the child be taught to
believe in an anthropomorphic God the Father,
or in an all-pervading medium of guidance
and control, or in the integrity of a cosmic
whole, with its transmutations, evolutions,
and indestructibilities. It matters little, for
they all lead in the same direction. Let there
but be a habit of nightly communion, not as a
mendicant or repeater of words more adapted
to the tongue of a sage, but as a humble
individual who submerges or asserts his individuality
as an integral part of a greater
whole. Such a habit does more to clean the
spirit and strengthen the soul to overcome
mere incidental emotionalism than any other
therapeutic agent known to him. Our schools
are as gardens for the cultivating, judicious
pruning and sustaining young life by gardeners
who have, or who ought to have, full knowledge
of the tender plants under their care. Our
churches are to the moral welfare of the
community as our schools are to the intellectual.
The church has been aptly termed ‘God’s
Garden,’ where the art of living good lives and
the making of character is helped by specially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
appointed gardeners. It is needless to say,
however, that the light of reason or sanity, as
bestowed upon us by Nature, is the light to
which all other considerations must give way
lest we in our turn too soon pass the borderland
of knowing things as they are.</p>

<h3>I. <i>Spiritual Healing in the Light of Modern
Medical Science</i></h3>

<p>I have been asked in this chapter to put
together some recent expressions of opinion
by members of my own profession on the
subject of ‘mental’ and ‘spiritual’ healing. No
attempt whatever is made to give an exhaustive
summary. It will be sufficient for my purpose
if I can make clear to the non-medical <span class="nowrap">reader&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) That there is nothing new in the elaborate
and confident pretensions now being thrust
forward by a variety of ‘healers.’</p>

<p>(2) That, so far from scientific medicine
‘standing helpless in the presence of a new
phenomenon,’ she is in possession of a very
large amount of clinical material on which
quite definite conclusions have been formed;
and, as always, she is perfectly ready to
consider and investigate any new evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
which might tend to mitigate the force of such
conclusions.</p>

<p>Now, there are obviously two main lines
of investigation. We may consider (1) the
<i>à priori</i> reasonableness of the claim that
certain bodily diseases can be cured by ‘mental’
or spiritual processes, or we may proceed to
(2) an <i>à posteriori</i> investigation of cases of
alleged cures. A third method of investigation,
that which is, of course, adopted in <i>all</i> cases
of scientific treatment of disease by new
methods, viz. the tabulation of all cases
treated, with the diagnosis, extent of disease,
immediate and permanent results, negative
as well as positive, noted in each case, is not
usually possible, since no psychic or spiritual
healer whom I have ever met seems to consider
such tabulation at all necessary or even
desirable.</p>

<p>In the first place, I submit a somewhat
long quotation from an admirable <span class="nowrap">paper<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> by
one of the greatest medical authorities in the
English-speaking world, Professor W. Osler.</p>

<p>‘An influenza-like outbreak of faith-healing
seems to have the public of the American
continent in its grip. It is an old story, the
oldest indeed in our history, and one in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
we have a strong hereditary interest, since
scientific medicine took its origin in a system
of faith-healing beside which all our modern
attempts are feeble imitations.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Once or
twice in each century the serpent entwining
the staff of Æsculapius gets restless, contorts,
and in his gambols swallows his tail, and all at
once in full circle back upon us come old thoughts
and old practices which for a time dominate
alike doctors and laity. As a profession we
took origin in the cult of Æsculapius&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
whose temples were at once magnificent shrines
and hospitals.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Amid lovely surroundings,
chosen for their salubrity, and connected with
famous springs, they were the sanatoriums of
the ancient world. The ritual of the cure is
well known, and has been beautifully described
by Pater in Marius the Epicurean.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
popular shrines of the Catholic Church to-day
are in some ways the direct descendants of
this Æsculapian cult, and the cures and votive
offerings at Lourdes and Ste. Anne are in every
way analogous to those of Epidaurus.’</p>

<p>Osler goes on to speak with much tenderness
of the apparently ineradicable nature of
the credulity evinced not merely by the
multitude but by persons educated widely, if
not well, in the matter of the healing of
disease. It is indeed a portentous fact. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
slightest acquaintance with the history of
therapeutics, the most casual examination
of the evidence of alleged cures, the faintest
stirring of the reasoning faculty, as the votary
asks himself whether the foremost pathologists
who work continuously with the best available
material in an institution devoted to the
scientific study of cancer will not be more
likely to arrive at a correct estimate of the
probability of cure, by means other than
extirpation, than a quite uninstructed <i>masseur</i>
who has taken to ‘spiritual healing,’ these,
one would suppose, would be sufficient to check
the growth of credulity which we see in such
evidence around us. Yet the reader will
probably feel that Osler is not going beyond
the warrant of easily ascertainable fact when
he says:</p>

<p>‘We must acknowledge its potency to-day
as effective among the most civilised people,
the people with whom education is the most
widely spread, yet who absorb with wholesale
credulity delusions as childish as any that have
enslaved the mind of man.’</p>

<p>Professor Osler’s conclusion is worth
quoting:</p>

<p>‘Having recently had to look over a large
literature on the subject of mental healing,
ancient and modern, I have tried to put the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
matter as succinctly as possible. In all ages
and in all climes the prayer of faith has saved
a certain number of the sick. The essentials
are, first, a strong and hopeful belief in a
dominant personality, which has varied naturally
in different countries and in different
ages: Buddha in India and in Japan, where
there are cults to match every recent vagary;
Æsculapius in ancient Greece and Rome;
our Saviour and a host of Saints in Christian
communities; and, lastly, an ordinary doctor
has served the purpose of common necessity
very well. Faith is the most precious asset in
our stock-in-trade. Once lost, how long does
a doctor keep his clientele? Secondly, certain
accessories&mdash;a shrine, a grotto, a church, a
temple, a hospital, a sanatorium [Osler might
have added the admirably devised entourage
in such places as ‘Physical Culture’ Institutes
and ‘light cure’ establishments], surroundings
that will impress favourably the imagination
of the patient. Thirdly, suggestion in one of
its varied forms&mdash;whether the negation of
disease and pain [as among the ‘Eddyites’],
the simple trust in Christ of the Peculiar
People, or the sweet reasonableness of the
psychotherapeutist. But there must be the
will-to-believe attitude of mind, the mental
receptiveness&mdash;in a word, the faith which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
has made bread-pills famous in the history of
medicine.’ We must, however, recognise the
limitations of ‘mental healing.’ ‘Potent as is
the influence of the mind on the body, and
many as are the miracle-like cures which may
be worked, all are in functional disorders, and
we know only too well that nowadays the
prayer of faith neither sets a broken thigh nor
checks an epidemic of typhoid fever.’</p>

<p>The following extract is from an article in
the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of March 13, 1909.
The article begins by quoting from a paper by
Dr. Allan Hamilton (U.S.A.) to the following
effect:</p>

<p>‘In all this agitation, it would almost seem
as if the intelligent physician had never made
use of psychotherapy, but that he was a
mechanical giver of drugs and took little or no
interest in his patients. If the new critics of
the medical profession, who have been so
active of late, would take the trouble to investigate,
they would often find, among the
great and successful men of all times and of
to-day, that the human side is very strongly
developed, and that their patients are studied
from every point of view, and treated accordingly.’</p>

<p>‘We would add,’ says the writer of the
article in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, ‘that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
the intelligent application of the physician’s
knowledge of the influence of the body on
the mind is the one condition of success in
the difficult art of dealing with patients and
reinforcing the curative power of Nature or,
what comes to the same thing, enabling sufferers
to work out their own deliverance from the
thraldom of functional disease. All really
great physicians have used this force, sometimes,
it may be, unconsciously, but often with deliberate
intent. It is the power of influencing
the mind of the patient or, in other words, of
exciting confidence in his gift of healing, that
makes what is called “personal magnetism.”&#8202;’</p>

<p>At this point I may be permitted to offer
one or two observations.</p>

<p>(1) To speak quite strictly, it is not a
question of <i>‘à priori’ possibility or impossibility</i>.
As Huxley pointed out, twenty years ago, few
things can be said to be <i>impossible</i> except
mathematical misstatements or manifest contradictions.
Thus 2 + 2 cannot possibly yield
any result but 4. A square circle, a raised
depression, are, in the strictest sense of the
term, <i>impossibilities</i>. But, with regard to
an enormous number of alleged phenomena
popularly styled <i>impossible</i>, what is really
meant is either that they are not impossible
at all, but only in some high degree improbable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
or that we have not sufficient knowledge
to enable us to say whether or not they are
impossible. In any case, before accepting
them, we are bound as honest men to demand
evidence which may be thoroughly sifted.
The sort of stuff which we usually get, when
we ask for such evidence, will be instanced
at a later stage.</p>

<p>(2) Again, to speak quite strictly, I do not
know that anyone would care to draw a hard-and-fast
line between what is ‘functional’ and
what is ‘organic.’ These terms are extremely
convenient, but we must remember that they
are only terms. There is an oft-recurring
danger, against which we all require to be
continually on our guard, of falling into the
old error of the realists. ‘Animate and inanimate’
(assuming that the recent claim
to have demonstrated in metals a process of
reproduction analogous to those observed in
protoplasm is endorsed, as seems probable),
‘genus and species,’ ‘animal and vegetable,’
these and many others are eminently useful
classifications, and the border line between
each and its opposite varies from comparative
precision to extreme vagueness. But in no
case are they absolutely precise in the sense
in which the distinction between an integer
and a vulgar fraction is precise. And in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
matter of the terms ‘functional’ and ‘organic’
we must walk very warily indeed. Is epilepsy
a functional neurosis or an organic disease?
Analogy suggests organic changes. No such
changes have been constantly demonstrated
by <i>post mortem</i> evidence; partly, of course,
because <i>post mortem</i> examinations of cases of
death in the epileptic or epileptiform condition
have been extremely rare, and are not very
common in cases where there is a well-authenticated
history of attacks; but partly because
our investigations into the minute anatomy of
many morbid conditions are at present barred
by the limitations of microscopic vision. We
have no right whatever to assert dogmatically
that there is no organic change in a tissue
because we cannot see it under a magnification
of 1000 diameters&mdash;though for a variety of
reasons, which all pathologists will recognise,
it is not altogether <i>probable</i> that a magnification
of 10,000 diameters would in such cases demonstrate
a constant change. In any case, if we
are told by a spiritual or psychic healer that
he cures cases of, let us say, old-standing chronic
nephritis or cirrhosis of the liver by his own
peculiar methods, our reply must be, not that
this is impossible because we are dealing with
organic disease, but rather <span class="nowrap">that&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) If he claims to act mentally or spiritually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
on the higher centres of the brain and so to reach
the diseased tissues, a cure is in the highest
degree unlikely, for a reason which will be
given at a later stage;</p>

<p>(2) If his method is avowedly quite empirical,
and he only professes to exercise a
power which he does not even dimly understand,
we must respectfully ask for evidence,
which can be examined and tested to the
satisfaction of a competent and impartial
mind.</p>

<p>Now, as to the influence of ‘suggestion,’
whether or not accompanied by other methods,
e.g. hypnotism, magnetism, electricity, &amp;c.,
on (so-called) functional conditions, modern
medical science speaks with no uncertain voice.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Harveian Society held
last October, much interesting information was
produced.</p>

<p>A paper of great and permanent value
was read by Dr. Claye Shaw on the ‘Influence
of Mind as a therapeutic agent.’ It is impossible
in the space at my disposal to quote more than
two brief extracts from his paper. He thus
defines ‘suggestion’:</p>

<p>‘Suggestion is the insinuation of a belief
or impulse into the mind of a subject by any
means, or by words or questions, usually by
emphatic declaration; also the impulse of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
trust and submission which leads to the
effectiveness of such incitement.’</p>

<p>On the effects of treatment by suggestion,
Dr. Claye Shaw writes:</p>

<p>‘It is with such conditions as chronic
inebriety, opium, or the drug habit, that
suggestion is most powerful; with acute
insanity I have not seen it successful, and,
though it has been fairly tested in asylum
practice, it has not obtained general recognition
as a therapeutic agent.’</p>

<p>A considerable number of medical men,
alienists and others, took part in the discussion
which followed the reading of the paper.</p>

<p>Dr. Bramwell cited many well-authenticated
cases where a cure or marked amelioration
had followed treatment by suggestion in cases
of this kind which had resisted all other
treatment. Among these were instances of
neurasthenia (‘la grande hystérie’), claustrophobia,
morphomania, tendency to suicide,
a morbid fear of cats. Dr. Seymour Tuke
said that he had found ‘suggestive treatment
marvellously effective in cases of inebriety
in which the will was under some sort of
control,’ but that he was ‘unable to make
encouraging report of the use of hypnotism
and suggestion amongst insane patients.’ [A
useful and discriminating testimony.] Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
Lloyd Tuckey had cured ‘many cases of
genuine dipsomania, which could not be
reached by drugs, by hypnotism&mdash;as well as
other intractable conditions, such as three
cases of Menière’s disease.’ Dr. R.&nbsp;H. Cole
said that, twenty years ago, when he was
a House Physician, he first tried to hypnotise
patients. Later, he went to Paris and attended
the ‘Salpétrière and Bernheim’s cliniques,
but was greatly disappointed in what he
saw.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In his experience of mental diseases
he had only seen it do good in one insane
patient. It had never had any effect in his
experience upon people with fixed delusions,
but it would cure dipsomania.’ Dr. T.&nbsp;F.
Woods had treated 4000 cases, and he described
a few of them in which he had obtained
remarkable results. One was that of a woman,
with severe asthma and delusions that she
was going to be cut in pieces, who was cured
by suggestion at one sitting, and had kept
well ever since. Another case of severe sciatica,
which had resisted every line of treatment
for eight months, was also cured rapidly.
He did not find it necessary to induce hypnotic
sleep. Dr. E.&nbsp;A. Ash thought that ‘genuine
hypnotism (the state of somnambulism) was
unsatisfactory in practice. Only a small proportion
of cases could be hypnotised, and these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
in his experience did no better than those
treated by simple suggestion. He quoted
two cases of nocturnal enuresis, one of which
he had failed to cure by hypnotism, whilst the
other was cured by suggestion, and a case of
blepharospasm, which had been cured by
suggestion, with light massage on the eyelids,
although a similar case treated only by
suggestion had not been relieved.’ Dr. W.&nbsp;H.
Blake described ‘a series of cases in which he
had used hypnotism with the utmost benefit.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
His most remarkable cures had been
effected in a case of asthma, for which the
patient was accustomed to drench himself
unavailingly with drugs, and in a severe case
of dipsomania.’</p>

<p>Here we have grouped together the expression
of the opinions of trained minds of
responsible medical men. The differences are
comparatively slight. The agreement is remarkable.
Not one of them (though in one
case as many as 4000 records are in his hands)
claims to have cured what are usually called
organic conditions. The whole question is
as to the best way in which suggestion can be
brought to bear on patients whose lives are
in many cases rendered miserable by persistent,
but none the less ‘functional,’ ailments.</p>

<p>Moreover, we observe that the result of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
years of patient clinical investigation is to lead
them to treat every variety of psychic therapeutics
as a form of ‘suggestion.’ In no case
is there so much as a hint that a new force,
viz. ‘spiritual healing,’ has appeared, different
in kind not only from other varieties of
suggestion but from the countless cults of
spiritual healing, which have flourished and
disappeared in the past or the relics of which
still survive in many continental and eastern
shrines.</p>

<p>Now, with regard to ‘spiritual healing’
in its present manifestation in our own country
the general attitude of medical science is well
described in an article which appeared in the
<i>British Medical Journal</i> of January 9, 1909.
The article begins by describing some meetings
of different societies, in some cases mutually
antagonistic, but all existing for the purpose
of advancing the claims of healing by ‘spiritual’
means. It goes on to say:</p>

<p>‘If all or any of them can show that they
have discovered a new force, or a new method
of applying one already known, to the cure of
disease, rational medicine will welcome a new
weapon. As we have often said, the wise
physician understands the action of the mind
or the spirit on the body, and uses it for the
benefit of his patient. A man who firmly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
believes in his doctor’s skill, or in the efficacy
of the treatment to which he is subjected, is in
the best possible condition for the operation
of curative forces. On the other hand, a
patient who believes that nothing can cure
him helps to seal his own doom. Avicenna
well said, <i>Plus interdum prodesse fiduciam in
medicum quam ipsam medicinam</i>. The “lady
of the highest rank,” who is reported to have
said that she would rather die under the care
of Sir Henry Halford than recover under that
of any other physician, must have been a
living tribute to his skill.</p>

<p>‘The fact cannot be too much insisted upon
that there is nothing in the least new about
faith healing. It is as old as medicine and
religion, which in the beginning were one, as
they still are among many savage tribes.
Faith can move mountains, and it matters
little on what it is based or how it is excited.
As John Hunter has told us, the touch of a
dead man’s hand has charmed away a tumour.
But there are limits to its action, and while
willing to accept faith as an adjuvant, no one
who knows anything about disease will admit
that by itself it can heal any but ailments the
origin of which lies hid in the unknown recesses
of the nervous system. By all means let us
know the full power of the spirit over the body.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
Only let us have facts that can be fairly and
fully tested. A scientifically trained doctor
takes nothing on trust, and there can be
no useful co-operation between medicine and
spiritual healing unless the facts of each case
are fully disclosed. That is the point where
science and faith part company; the former
is as importunate as Arthur Clennam at the
Circumlocution Office, and the wonder workers
are as painfully surprised at this as the youthful
Barnacle was at the persistence of “the
fella that wanted to know, you know.”&#8202;’</p>

<p>Let us dispose at once of one simple
question of fact. Modern medical science has
given the ‘spiritual healers,’ who claim to
cure any and every disease by touch or prayer
or unction, an absolutely fair hearing. Evidence
is asked for, and, if it is forthcoming, is
patiently investigated, no matter how antecedently
unlikely may be the pretensions
which such evidence is brought forward to
support.</p>

<p>The general attitude of mind of the supporters
of the ‘spiritual healers’ is shown by
the following illuminating extract, quoted by
Sir H. Morris in the course of a recent lecture
on ‘Looking back’:</p>

<p>‘We have no difficulty in believing that
ulcers that have a malignant aspect may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
healed by the hope that comes from a potent
suggestion. We have ourselves known of more
than one case in which every clinical sign
of malignant disease of the stomach was
present, and in which a cure was effected by
means that could only have derived their
potency from suggestion.’</p>

<p>People who are prepared to accept this
<i>without clearly ascertained and properly sifted
evidence</i> will accept anything. They simply
believe what they wish to believe. When one
widely advertised ‘case of spiritual healing’
breaks down on investigation, another is put
forward.</p>

<p>Indeed, for the most part they have no
idea as to what constitutes evidence in these
matters. In many cases the unsupported
statement of a patient, as to the diagnosis
pronounced by a medical man, is calmly
accepted by them as though there were no
need of further investigation. We have heard,
perhaps, more than enough of a highly placed
dignitary of the Church who believes (no
doubt quite sincerely) that he was cured of
cancer by the ministrations of one of these
‘healers,’ after an absolute diagnosis as to the
existence of an inoperable tumour had been
made by a leading specialist. The repeated
denial by the specialist in question, that he ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
supposed the condition which he examined to be
cancerous, makes no difference. The patient
continues to announce as a fact what is almost
demonstrably untrue; and his followers will
no doubt continue to accept his statement in
preference to first-hand evidence, so long as this
particular cult survives.</p>

<p>But, for those who are not blinded by
ignorant credulity, the following extracts from
a letter from Dr. Combe Atthill may be of
interest. Dr. Atthill’s experience could, of
course, be paralleled by any medical man
of long practice:</p>

<p>‘Shortly after I retired from practice,
some ten years ago, a well-known clergyman
wrote to me, saying that members of his
congregation were being much disturbed by the
advent amongst them of a lady professing herself
to be a faith healer, and saying that her
conversion was due to the fact of my having
told her that she was suffering from a dreadful
disease, and that her sole hope of cure lay in
the performance of a very dangerous operation.
She refused to submit to this, and instead
placed herself in the hands of “the healer,”
and was cured. He concluded by asking me
to give him particulars of her case.</p>

<p>‘I had no recollection of any such patient,
but, as the name was given, I traced her, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
found the following particulars recorded in my
case book.</p>

<p>‘I had only seen the lady once in my own
house, when she stated that she was well past
middle life, and for more than a year had been
weakened by a well-known condition.</p>

<p>‘On my telling her I must examine her
she replied that she could not submit to it that
day for sufficient reasons, so I arranged that
when she was in a condition for examination
she would let me know, and I would call on
her and examine her. I made no diagnosis, and
gave no opinion as to the nature of the case.
I said no word about performing an operation.</p>

<p>‘Instead of writing to me to call on her,
she went to London. No doubt an examination
would have revealed the fact that no
disease ever existed.</p>

<p>‘It is impossible to deal with patients of
this class. Their mental equilibrium is disturbed;
they distort what the doctor may
say, and not infrequently invent and circulate
statements he never made.’</p>


<h3>II. <i>The Society of Emmanuel</i></h3>

<p>Special attention has been directed of late
to the claims of the ‘Society of Emmanuel.’
This society appears to profess adherence to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
the tenets of the Church of England, though,
except for Dr. Mylne (formerly Bishop of
Bombay), no well-known churchman, lay or
cleric, seems to be a member of the executive.
The names of some ladies of title are given
in the list of the General Committee. The
president and principal ‘healer’ is a Mr.
James M. Hickson. The objects of the society
are closely akin to those of other similar
societies, except that they have a distinctly
‘Church’ flavour. For instance:</p>

<p>‘To develop the Divine gifts left to His
Church by the Master, especially the gift of
healing by prayer and laying on of hands,
with the object of using these Divine gifts&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
for the healing of the body.’</p>

<p>A perusal of its literature reveals the usual
pretension to cure and to have cured any and
every disease. Nothing like a tabulated list of
cases treated appears anywhere. The society
has now opened a ‘Hospice,’ where free treatment
(by prayer and laying on of hands, &amp;c.)
is given by the aforesaid Mr. Hickson.</p>

<p>For some time the <i>British Medical Journal</i>,
the official organ of the British Medical
Association, called attention to widely advertised
‘cures,’ and asked for information
which would make it possible for an investigation
into the true facts to be carried out. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
results were hardly satisfactory. Here are
some of the cases:</p>

<p>(1) In the <i>British Medical Journal</i> (May 1,
1909) the following case is given as recorded
in <i>The Healer</i> (the organ of the Society of
Emmanuel):</p>

<p>‘The patient fell and injured the patella,
which had previously been broken four times&mdash;two
doctors expressed the opinion that he
would never have full use of the knee again.
It was very painful and quite callous (<i>sic</i>) at
the time of the first treatment by prayer, but
in twenty minutes he was able to bend it
without help; the following day to walk about
the house, and after four visits to resume
ordinary duties.’</p>

<p>Inquiries failed to elicit any details which
would enable investigation to be made.</p>

<p>(2) From the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of
June 5, 1909:</p>

<p>‘Mr. Hickson is reported to have said that
he has another case of “cancer of the throat”
under his care; the patient had undergone
two operations before going to him, and is
now apparently getting well. We should be
glad to have particulars of so interesting a case,
but we doubt whether they will be forthcoming.’</p>

<p>Apparently they were not. But the case
was identified without difficulty. A clergyman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
the vicar of a country parish in the
Oxford diocese, was under ‘treatment’ by
Mr. Hickson at this time for what was undoubtedly
cancer (epithelioma) of the larynx.
A friend of mine who saw him in the summer
described him as being quite certain that he
was being cured, though he looked extremely
ill and could hardly speak above a whisper.
A few weeks later the patient died. If
Mr. Hickson has anywhere publicly announced
the failure of his ‘treatment’ in this case,
after having stated that the patient was
‘apparently getting well,’ no such announcement
has come under my notice.</p>

<p>(3) In its issue of June 12, 1909, the <i>British
Medical Journal</i> published a quotation from the
<i>Evening News</i>, which ran as follows:</p>

<p>‘The following account of a cure of
cancer is furnished by a lady member of the
Society of Emmanuel: “The patient was a
Bishop of the Church of England. The doctors
abandoned all hope of a cure. Then Mr.
Hickson took the case in hand. He arrived
on the morning of the day on which the
sufferer had to undergo an operation. Mr.
Hickson prayed with him and anointed him,
followed by a laying on of hands (<i>sic</i>). In
the afternoon the surgeon arrived and made
his examination. He was greatly surprised.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
‘The case puzzles me,’ he said. ‘There is
a mark of a new wound, but the cancer has
gone!’ The cleric in question is now perfectly
well, and was with us the other day,
but I believe the surgeon has not yet recovered
from his surprise.”&#8202;’</p>

<p>The usual request to Mr. Hickson or any
member of the Society of Emmanuel to furnish
details of this truly miraculous cure, which
could serve as a basis of investigation, followed,
but no reply came to hand. Again, I ask,
has Mr. Hickson publicly repudiated this
account of his healing powers?</p>

<p>(4) The following is an extract from an
article in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of May
22, 1909:</p>


<p class="tac mt15em">‘SPIRITUAL HEALING AND CANCER.</p>

<p>‘One of the most serious difficulties in arriving
at a correct conclusion as to the curative powers
claimed for spiritual healing is the intangible
nature of the evidence. For instance, most
of the patients on behalf of whom prayers were
asked in the earlier numbers of <i>The Healer</i>&mdash;which
is published by Mr. J.&nbsp;M. Hickson, and
which, we suppose, may be regarded as the
organ of the Society of Emmanuel of which
that gentleman is the president&mdash;are vaguely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
described as suffering from “rheumatism,” “loss
of nerve power,” “spinal trouble,” “internal
weakness,” “low vitality and great weakness,”
“heart trouble,” “internal trouble.” Some, indeed,
are said to be the subjects of “locomotor
ataxy” and “consumption,” but no particulars
are given by which the diagnosis can be
checked, and it is difficult or impossible to
trace the result of the treatment. In a report
of the past year published in the number for
November 1908, Mr. Hickson does give some
details of a few cases. The two following
taken at random may be given as specimens:
“Priest. Cancer in bowel. Specialist, who
examined him nine months ago under an
anaesthetic, said that an operation was impossible,
and that he could not live for more than
about three months. He then sought help
through Divine Healing, when he was anointed
with oil in the name of the Lord, and Mr.
Hickson laid his hands on him in prayer,
after which he was examined by the same
Specialist, who found that a process of absorption
was taking place. He is now quite well.”
“Lady’s Maid. Age about 28. Suffering from
rupture, which gave great pain. One year
under treatment at Middlesex Hospital, and,
while waiting for an in-patient’s bed for operation,
was advised to seek help through Divine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
Healing. After three visits to Mr. Hickson,
two months ago, she is now quite well and
strong, with no pain or swelling. Her mistress
also reports that serious defects of her character
are no longer apparent and her whole spiritual
nature is quickened and her duties are better
done.”</p>

<p>‘These cases are sufficiently definite to be
tested, and we should be glad if Mr. Hickson
would supply us with the information necessary
for the purpose. We should undertake not
to publish the names of the patients or any
particulars by which they could be identified.
We should place the results of our investigation
honestly before our readers.’</p>

<p>Result: No reply. If the first of these
cases is the one already referred to, it will be
observed that the clear and definite denial of
the specialist in question goes for nothing;
also that, like all other stories of the kind,
this has lost nothing in the telling.</p>

<p>(5) The article goes on:</p>

<p>‘In the meantime, we have succeeded in
tracing a case more remarkable than either
of the two just cited, and the result is
very instructive. It was related in the third
number of <i>The Healer</i> (March 1908, p.&nbsp;9)
by the Right Rev. L.&nbsp;G. Mylne, D.D., formerly
Bishop of Bombay, in a paper entitled “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
Anointing of the Sick for their Healing.”
It has already been quoted in the <i>British
Medical Journal</i> of January 9, 1909, p.&nbsp;109;
but, to enable the reader to form a correct
judgment on the subject, it must be repeated
here. Bishop Mylne said: “In the latest
up-to-date book on cancer, which is in the
hands of the most scientific men of to-day,
there is a case quoted which is, I have no doubt,
correctly said to be a unique one of <i>abortive</i>
cancer. The case is fully described from a
medical point of view&mdash;how a patient, stricken
unquestionably with cancer, was found to have,
in place of the tumour, something which
could only be called abortive cancer, the like
of which was never heard of before. I happen
to know the whole history of the case from
the brother of the patient, himself a medical
man. It was this: The patient had been
suffering from a serious affection of the throat.
He went to one specialist after another.
Three eminent men told him without hesitation
that he was suffering from a cancer growing
on the vocal cords, and that nothing but their
total excision could save his life. He was a
hard-working priest of our Church, and, of
course, the operation meant that he would
never utter a word again. However, his life
had to be saved. The doctors came; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
throat was laid open; the operator had his
knife in his hand to excise the vocal cords.
He stopped dead. Instead of applying the
blade of the knife, he took hold, between his
thumb and the handle, of all he found there,
and peeled it off, just like the skin of a fruit.
Between the diagnosis and the operation the
patient had been anointed with oil in the name
of the Lord. That is one of not a few cases
which some of us know about, but it is by far
the best defined one I know of, and one that
is actually celebrated in medical circles; not, of
course, being quoted as an instance of what
may be done by anointing, but as a case
unique in surgical experience.” We went on to
say that we should be glad to have fuller
particulars, and we respectfully invited Bishop
Mylne to furnish us with the name of the
“latest up-to-date book on cancer” from
which he quoted.</p>

<p>‘In the meantime, we had been put on the
track of the case by a distinguished physician,
and had obtained a report of the case from
the surgeon who operated. All, therefore,
that was wanting was the name of the book
from which the quotation purported to be
taken. We communicated with Bishop Mylne
on the subject, and we have to acknowledge
the courtesy with which he received our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
request for information and the pains he took
to procure it for us. <i>His Lordship was,
however, unable to gain the consent of those
to whom he applied to help in any way in
supplying an answer to a very simple question</i><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span>
As the matter is one of general interest not only
to the medical profession but to the whole of
mankind, we think it right to give the true
facts of the case, of course without disclosing
the patient’s identity.</p>

<p>‘The operator was Mr. Butlin, who has been
good enough to give us permission to publish
the following account. He saw the patient,
who was at that time thirty-seven years of age,
in 1890. There was then a very white patch,
flat and sessile, on the middle of the left vocal
cord, looking like a papillary growth. A month
later the surface seemed to be ulcerated.
The patient was seen by other well-known
specialists, who, like Mr. Butlin himself, were
puzzled as to the nature of the disease.
Tubercle, papillary growth and malignant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
disease were in turn considered, but no
definite conclusion was arrived at. The
patient was treated in various ways for four
months before it was thought right to open
the larynx. Mr. Butlin then operated in the
presence of an eminent specialist, a distinguished
surgeon, and another medical man, a friend of
the patient.’</p>

<p>Somewhat to curtail the account, let me
simply say that when the larynx was opened it
appeared that they had to do with a case either
of what is known as leukoplakia or a rather
rare form of papilloma. The latter seemed on
the face of it to be the more probable, though
evidently Mr. Butlin did not think so. Whatever
it was, it was certainly not malignant.
It was scraped away without difficulty: no
signs of infiltration were observed, and, when
last heard of, the patient’s recovery seemed
to be complete. The rest of the article in
the <i>British Medical Journal</i> consists of some
criticisms of Dr. Mylne’s proceedings, which
certainly do not appear to me to err on the
side of severity.</p>

<p>The Society of Emmanuel has at last
consented to allow the British Medical Association
to carry out a full investigation into its
alleged cures. The report will be interesting
reading. Incidentally, it will be instructive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
to note how many of the above cases have
been submitted to the investigators.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the danger is a real one.
Probably an investigation into the facts
of the ‘cures’ reported by other ‘psychotherapeutic’
societies would yield much the
same results as have attended the inquiries
into the claims of the Society of Emmanuel.
Not one of them, so far as I know, even
attempts to put its work on a scientific basis;
and all claim implicitly, if not explicitly, that
they possess a power to cure the most malignant
organic diseases as well as functional
neuroses.</p>

<p>If this cult is allowed to spread among the
ignorant and credulous (and it seems to me
that, <i>pari passu</i> with waning faith, the most
childish credulity is rapidly increasing in our
midst, often appearing in the most unexpected
places), a golden opportunity will be offered
to plausible impostors, without even the pretence
of a scientific training, to set up as
‘healers’ and reap a rich harvest of gain.
A few startling successes will be widely
advertised, and the huge tale of failures
quietly ignored. But a more serious danger
lies behind.</p>

<p>I take the following from the <i>British Medical
Journal</i> of May 1, 1909:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<p>‘A man with some slight symptoms of
bladder trouble consulted an eminent specialist,
who discovered a small growth which could
easily have been removed. It was arranged
that the patient should undergo an operation.
In the meantime he fell among Christian
Scientists, who persuaded him that he was quite
well. And, indeed, for a time the symptoms
almost ceased. But the insidious disease
remorselessly went its way, till the unfortunate
patient was past all surgery.’</p>

<p>If it be said that the societies I have
mentioned repudiate all connexion with Christian
Science, I reply that by their fruits must
they be judged. Both Christian Science and
the various associations for spiritual healing
profess to heal any and every disease, and
offer proofs of their claim, which, whenever
they have been tested, have been shown to be
utterly without foundation.</p>


<h3>III. <i>Spiritual Healing on a Scientific Basis</i></h3>

<p>In a book which has recently appeared,
‘Body and Soul,’ by the Rev. Percy Dearmer,
we have a serious and able attempt to put
‘spiritual healing’ on a scientific basis. Considerations
of space do not permit me to deal
as fully as I should wish with this really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
interesting book, but, if I may try to put the
general argument into a single paragraph,
Mr. Dearmer’s contention is as follows:</p>

<p>Bodily functions and bodily health are
regulated and sustained by what may be called
the lower nerve centres in the medulla of the
brain. It is by the exercise of these centres,
which in turn control the circulation, the
secretion of various glands, &amp;c., that the body
combats disease. This work is continually
going on and we are for the most part quite
unconscious of it. But, says Mr. Dearmer,
‘we now know that these centres are in direct
connexion with the higher centres of the
cortex of the brain.’ I should think we do. So
did our ancestors a hundred years ago. Their
knowledge of the work of such centres as the
vasomotor, the respiratory, the heat-regulating,
&amp;c., was fragmentary and imperfect to the last
degree, but not one of them had any doubt
that myriads of nerve fibres connected the
cortex with the medulla. Let us, therefore,
know how to stimulate the cortex, and all
disease (organic as well as functional) can be
cured. Hence, when our Lord cured Bartimæus’s
blindness, and when a ‘healer’ cures
locomotor ataxy, they are performing a function
quite as natural as in the case of a doctor
who cures malaria with quinine or restores the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
use of muscles in musculo-spiral paralysis by
the use of the interrupted current.</p>

<p>This sounds plausible enough. There is
nothing very new in it; indeed, when we come
to analyse it, we shall see that, so far as general
principles go, there is nothing which was not
perfectly familiar in Sydenham’s day, or which
the most materialistic practitioner of our own
time would not admit without a moment’s
hesitation. But, of the limitations of his
process, Mr. Dearmer only seems to have a
confused idea. Let us take one of the instances
which he adduces in illustration of his argument.
He is speaking (p.&nbsp;33) of the familiar phenomenon
of blushing. ‘When a person blushes,’
says our author, ‘the small arteries are relaxed
and dilate, the amount of blood in them is
increased, and this hot red fluid flows in such
quantities through the capillaries of the skin
that the skin itself becomes hot and red. It is
strange that the thought “He says I am a
pretty girl” should cause the small arteries
to behave in this way; but the physiological
explanation is simple enough. These arteries
are supplied with muscles which regulate
them, and all muscles are worked by nerves.
The thought in the higher conscious centres
has somehow seen fit to hitch itself on to the
arterial muscles, just as when we telephone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
to a friend in the City the exchange connects
us on to his office. <i>Now, supposing it to be
possible to cure a man, say of indigestion by
thought, the process would be the same.</i>’</p>

<p>‘Supposing it to be possible to cure a man
of indigestion by thought,’ this is a statement
which no one would wish to dispute. But
I expect Mr. Dearmer would be surprised to
hear that the analogy of the excitation of the
vaso-dilator centre, which causes blushing, can
be applied to only a few varieties of indigestion.
Roughly, the commonest causes of indigestion
might be said to be: (<i>a</i>) anæmia, or an
insufficient supply of blood to the mucous
membrane of the stomach; (<i>b</i>) an imperfect
secretion of hydrochloric acid and the digestive
fluids owing to structural defects in the glands
of the stomach, usually a hereditary condition;
(<i>c</i>) a dilated organ; (<i>d</i>) some pathological
condition of the accessory large glands, e.g.
liver and pancreas; (<i>e</i>) dyspepsia, owing to
faulty balance of the nervous system. Any
one of these five is fairly common, but only
in the last is there a shred of evidence for
supposing that suggestion or any other
factor which would cause the higher, and
through them the lower, nervous centres to
show a healthy activity, would bring about
amelioration or a cure, while there is much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
evidence against any supposition of the
kind.</p>

<p>Mr. Dearmer elsewhere lays it down that
healing by excitation of the ‘undermind’ is
only possible where the case is ‘curable.’ If,
he says in effect, the case is incurable, then
anything like spiritual or faith healing or
suggestion will fail to bring about a cure
[will the faith-healers kindly take note of this
admission?], <i>but so will any other more material
means</i>. To this one may be permitted to reply:</p>

<p>(i) In many acute infections, e.g. scarlet
fever, typhoid fever, cholera, where complete
recovery may be expected if (<i>a</i>) the infection
is not too virulent, (<i>b</i>) the resisting power of
the tissues is vigorous and unimpaired, suggestion
in any form&mdash;hope, the desire to live,
the unexpected arrival of a much-loved friend,
&amp;c.&mdash;will most certainly assist the patient to
battle with the disease. But these factors
will always operate without the elaboration
of a psychotherapeutic philosophy, and really
I do not like the idea of encouraging the
adoption of a solemn form of prayer, unction,
and the laying on of hands, when all the
evidence to hand points to this ‘treatment’
having in acute infections just as much value
as (but no more than) the realisation on the
part of the patient that, if he dies at that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
particular time, his business will be left in an
unsatisfactory condition and perhaps in incompetent
hands.</p>

<p>(ii) In the case of what are usually termed
chronic ‘organic’ conditions, honours are no
longer even. Let us take four crucial examples.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Malignant tumours.</p>

<p>Certainly we have no warrant for supposing
that in any, except cases of the extremest
rarity, the ‘undermind’ can possibly effect a
cure. But in a very large number of cases
which are taken sufficiently early and are
otherwise favourable, extirpation by the surgeon’s
knife can and does save the life of
the individual and prevent recurrence of
the tumour. I say again that an attitude
of hesitancy on this subject by those who,
like Mr. Dearmer, approach the question in a
scientific spirit, and their quasi-acceptance of
the alleged cures of cancer by spiritual and
other healers, which hopelessly break down
when anything like impartial investigation is
brought to bear on them&mdash;all this is likely
to be productive of infinite harm. In the
case of cancer or sarcoma a day’s delay may
make the whole difference between hope and
despair.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A class of disease of which a good
example is tuberculous affections of bone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

<p>Here we have to do with what is strictly
a non-malignant condition. That is to say,
there is always a fair ground for hoping that
surgery may operate like auxiliary steam
power in the battleships of the Crimean period.
Help nature (or the ‘undermind’) enough and,
other conditions being favourable, a tolerably
satisfactory result may be expected. But,
really, clinical experience in all civilised communities
for the past fifty or sixty years
must be allowed to have some value; and the
value surely lies in this, that the experienced
surgeon knows more or less exactly when to
excise or scrape and when to refrain. That
anyone should prefer to this the services
of some unqualified, inexperienced ‘healer,’
who bids his patient trust in prayer, unction,
or whatever his method is, telling him that
if his faith is sufficient the largest sinus
will be cleared up and the most distressing
ankylosis broken down, simply strikes me
with amazement. If the ‘healers’ really wish
us to believe their claims, let them produce
a properly codified list of cases which can be
thoroughly investigated.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Diseases in which certain drugs are
empirically known to act with marked success,
e.g. malaria. Here, properly graduated
quantities of quinine <i>can</i> and <i>do</i> effect an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
absolute cure. There is no evidence whatever
that suggestion in any form can do the
same.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) What may be called progressive organic
conditions, e.g. cirrhosis of the liver.</p>

<p>I entirely agree that, in the conditions of
which this is an example, scientific medicine
can only hope to ameliorate and render life
more tolerable to the sufferer.</p>

<p>But here I come to close grips with our
author, whose close and fair reasoning it is
a real pleasure to follow. In a very large
proportion of the diseases from which people
die, the pathological condition consists in the
deposition of fibrous tissue in some organ or
part of the general system. The causes and
clinical varieties are endless, but the result
the same. To instance only a few, we have:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Granular kidney, i.e. chronic Bright’s
disease.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Cirrhotic liver.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Arterio-sclerosis, resulting in cerebral
hæmorrhage (stroke&mdash;apoplexy&mdash;paralysis).</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Locomotor ataxy.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Tuberculous peritonitis with adhesions.</p>

<p>Now, in all these, the fibrous tissue is first
deposited as an effort on the part of Nature to
repair the damage done by an acute or chronic
inflammation. But, unfortunately, not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
does this fibrous tissue take the place of
normal cells, whose activity is of the utmost
importance in preserving the health of the
individual, but it invariably tends after a time
to contract; from which contraction further
damage and the gravest results are likely to
ensue. It will be observed that in its simplest
form a fibrotic change is of the nature of real
repair. Thus, after a deep cut or extensive
injury to the skin, we all know that a ‘scar’
results. This affords admirable protection to
the damaged area. Nor does the subsequent
contraction seriously matter. Care has to be
taken to allow for it in the treatment of
extensive burns, and considerable allowance
is made for contraction in the suturing of skin
incisions made in the course of an operation.
But except when the scar is on the face, where
it is objectionable for cosmetic reasons, a
contracting superficial scar is seldom a cause
of serious inconvenience. But the case is
very different in the kidney or the spinal
cord. Contraction there causes an extensive
destruction of delicate cells, and, by cutting off
the blood supply, a great impairment of
function, if not actual necrosis, of an infinite
number of cells which were not directly
affected by the preceding inflammation. And
so the vicious circle goes on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<p>Does Nature make no effort to play the part
of the spear of Achilles and ‘heal the wounds
which she herself has made’? Only to a
negligible extent, on account of the vicious
circle just alluded to. So we have the curious
phenomenon that in the skin and round the
broken ends of a fractured bone (for what is
called callus is really only fibrous tissue with
special bony elements superimposed) fibrous
tissue is very slowly but more or less steadily
absorbed; while in the places where such
absorption would be of the utmost value to the
individual it hardly takes place at all.</p>

<p>Now, the reader will observe that this
fibrous tissue is, in the first instance, laid down
by the activity of leucocytes acting, to some
extent at any rate, in obedience to impulses
from the circulatory centres of the medulla,
to which Mr. Dearmer quite rightly attaches
considerable importance. They make up, in
fact, his ‘undermind.’ I can only say that,
so far as any pathological evidence which we
possess justifies us in coming to a definite
conclusion, we can but suppose that a stimulation
of these lower centres to greater activity,
by excitation through suggestion of the higher
ones, would lead to a further deposition of
fibrous tissue, to the great detriment of the
general condition of the patient. Any attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
at subsequent absorption seems to be practically
negligible.</p>

<p>So, in the case of blind Bartimæus, Mr.
Dearmer’s contention that our Lord acted by
suggestion is almost demonstrably untrue.
At least, it is only even remotely probable on
the supposition that Bartimæus was suffering
from snow blindness, toxic amblyopia, or
one of those rare conditions following on such
a sudden, but transitory, disturbance of the
nervous system as sea-sickness. And since
snow blindness is for obvious reasons unknown
in Palestine, and since he certainly did not
use tobacco, and probably, like most Jews,
hated the sea, this does not seem to be a likely
explanation. If, on the other hand, it was
a case of corneal opacity following trachoma,
cataract, or glaucoma, or some condition
resulting in atrophy of the optic nerve, it may
be safely affirmed that the method of healing
was emphatically not that so carefully worked
out by Mr. Dearmer.</p>


<h3>IV. <i>The ‘Neurotic’ Theory of the Miracles of
the New Testament</i></h3>

<p>The whole question of our Lord’s miracles
of healing, regarded merely as so many faith
cures, has been discussed in an admirable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
essay contributed by Dr. R.&nbsp;J. Ryle to the
<i>Hibbert Journal</i> of April 1907. He had before
him no such systematic attempt to defend
this view as that made by Mr. Dearmer,
but only the rather loose theorising of certain
‘Modernists’ who, however competent they
may be to deal with textual criticism, are
hardly in their element when reviewing pathological
probabilities. Dr. Ryle quotes Professor
Harnack as saying:</p>

<p>‘That the earth in its course stood still,
that a she-ass spoke, that a storm was quieted
by a word, we do not believe, and we shall never
again believe; but that the lame walked, the
blind saw, and the deaf heard will not be so
summarily dismissed as an illusion.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span></p>

<p>Others write to the same effect. ‘Progressive
criticism,’ says Dr. Ryle, ‘has adopted,
with much assurance, the opinion that the
diseases which were healed were what doctors
commonly speak of as functional diseases of the
nervous system, and that the production of a
strong mental impression was the means by
which the miracles of healing were brought
about. Upon this point there seems to be a
practical unanimity no less decided than that
which has been reached among critics of the
liberal school upon the other two points.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
Thus Dr. Abbott tells us that the mighty
works were simply “acts of faith-healing on a
mighty scale.” The “Encyclopædia Biblica”
lays it down that “it is quite permissible for us
to regard as historical only those of the class
which, even at the present day, physicians are
able to effect by psychical methods.” Principal
Estlin Carpenter (in the “First Three Gospels”)
says, “The real force which worked the patient’s
cure dwelt in his own mind: the power of
Jesus lay in the potency of his personality to
evoke this force.”</p>

<p>‘The writers have adopted what may be
called, for brevity, the Neurotic Theory. It
is for them to show by an actual examination
of the records that the ministry of healing
which is admitted “to stand on as firm historical
ground as the best accredited parts of the
teaching,” consisted in the curing of neurotic
patients by strong mental impressions. Have
they done so?’</p>

<p>Dr. Ryle has, of course, no difficulty in
showing that they have done nothing of the
kind.</p>

<p>‘It is not too much to say that no one of the
writers who has pinned his faith to the Neurotic
Theory has made any attempt to carry it out
in detail. We are offered a number of quite
commonplace allusions to the power of mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
over body, and we find a complacent conviction
expressed in several ways by several writers
to the effect that a certain class of disorders,
which are vaguely alluded to as “nervous,” are
promptly curable by emotional methods. But
we do not find any recognition of the fact that
only a small portion of the diseases to which
human flesh is heir are nervous diseases; and
that of nervous diseases, again, only a very
small and unimportant group admit of cure
in this way.</p>

<p>‘What the critics have to do if they wish to
convince their readers of the Neurotic Theory
of the miracles of healing is nothing less than
this:</p>

<p>‘1. They must show that the diseases which
Christ is said to have cured were of the kind
which experience proves to admit of psychical
treatment.</p>

<p>‘2. They must show some good grounds for
the assertion that the way in which the cures
of the healing ministry were effected was the
way by which at the present day such cures
are effected, when what has been called moral
therapeutics has been the method employed.’</p>

<p>The difficulty is obvious. If our Lord was
merely a faith healer, the results of long and
laborious investigations into many faith-healing
systems, all presenting very much the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
same features both in methods of treatment
and effects, justify us in assuming that the
number of cures would have been strictly
limited.</p>

<p>‘But then, quickly enough, would follow the
discovery that the powers of healing were
available not for all, but only for a small
and limited group of disorders; for in any
casual collection of sick people, though there
might be perhaps here one and here another
suitable patient for a faith-healing exhibition,
the majority would be unsuitable. What,
then, of the failures?</p>

<p>‘The difficulty here referred to has not been
wholly overlooked, and it is worth while to
notice how the attempt has been made to
meet it. “Did a kind of instinct (asks Dr.
Abbott) tell Him that the restoration of a lost
limb was not like the cure of a paralytic, not
one of the works prepared for Him by His
Father?” and again, “Experience and some
kind of intuition may have enabled Him to
distinguish those cases which He could heal
from those (a far more numerous class) which
He could not.”</p>

<p>‘The suggestion would not commend itself
to a medical reader as a very happy way out
of the difficulty. The naïve supposition that
in cases of disease which require unusually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
minute and scientific investigation diagnosis
was made “by a kind of instinct” or “some
kind of intuition” is quite on a par with the
innocent conception of the nature of diseases of
the nervous system which Dr. Abbott shows
elsewhere. Dr. Abbott would hesitate to allow
that Jesus had a kind of instinct to guide
Him safely concerning the Davidic origin of a
psalm or the date of the taking of Jerusalem.
Why should he imagine that he was less likely
to be at fault in the presence of equally
difficult problems of another kind? The
assumption of an infallible capacity for discrimination,
which could arrive at correct
conclusions without the use of any of the
methods and appliances of scientific medicine,
is merely to substitute one kind of “supernaturalism”
for another. A miraculous faculty
of diagnosis is no easier of acceptance than
a miraculous cure. A “kind of instinct” is
an absurd supposition.’</p>

<p>Dr. Ryle then examines in detail certain of
the healing miracles as related by the Evangelists.
The result is to leave the intelligent
reader in no doubt that in nine out of ten of the
cases of ‘paralysis’ brought to Him, our Lord
would have been, on the ‘neurotic’ hypothesis,
no more likely to effect a cure than (to take
Dr. Abbott’s example) in ‘the restoration of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
a lost limb.’ His clear account of the case of
the man with the withered hand, which the
non-medical reader will be able to follow
without difficulty, is worth quoting in full.</p>

<p>‘In the story of the man with the withered
hand it is probable that we have to do with
another case of paralysis; and if so, we may
assume with considerable confidence that the
case was one of “infantile paralysis.” This is
the affection to which at the present day nearly
all the instances of “withered hand” or of
“withered leg” are owing. A child who has
been in good health, or has suffered perhaps
from a few days of feverishness, is found to
have lost power in an arm or leg. The limb
hangs flaccid and motionless. The muscles are
found to be wasting when the limb is examined
a week or two later, and the limb to be cold.
For a month or two there may be a little
recovery of movement. This soon stops, and
the arm or leg remains ever after more or less
powerless and shrunken and cold. Normal
growth is largely checked, and, in addition to
the actual atrophy and arrest of development,
various contractions and deformities become
established as time goes on. After death the
muscles are found to have become much
diminished and shrunken, and throughout a
certain portion of the spinal cord, corresponding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
with the affected limb, destructive changes
are found to have occurred where the normal
structure of ganglion cells and nerve fibres is
replaced by the remains of the inflammatory
process which has been the cause of the palsy.
Such is the ordinary history of a withered hand.
Here the very word “withered,” which aptly
describes the condition of the limb, is the most
appropriate description of the result of the
process which has taken place. If such was the
pathology of the case described in Mark iii. 1,
it is needless to say that, although it belongs
to the group of the nervous diseases, it does
not belong to that class of nervous disease
which admits of treatment by moral impression
or emotional shock.’</p>

<p>If this is accepted in the case of what
may truly be described as ‘nervous diseases,’
then <i>à fortiori</i> the improbability of the view
taken by ‘progressive criticism’ is enormously
enhanced when we come to consider the healing
of the blind, the ‘woman with an issue of blood,’
and others where the nervous system was not
primarily, if at all, affected.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the whole matter seems
to be this. Medical science has at her command
a vast accumulation of clinical material
on which she is able to form a clearly reasoned
judgment. There is no such thing in Medicine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
as a ‘chose jugée.’ No single verdict ever
found but is open to revision if the evidence is
satisfactory. But we do claim that it should
be recognised, by all who have the interests of
truth at heart, that the limits of ‘psychotherapeutics,’
‘spiritual’ or otherwise, are,
according to our present knowledge, sufficiently
well defined, and that nothing has yet been
brought forward to warrant anyone in making
an exception in favour of any one society or
method.</p>


<h3>V. <i>Clergy and Doctors</i></h3>

<p>So much may be said on the critical side.</p>

<p>A few words, for many are not needed, may
be added as to the positive advantages of a
clear understanding between the Church and
scientific Medicine, as to the spheres in which
both may hope to operate in fulfilment of a
genuine desire to cure or alleviate bodily disease.</p>

<p>(1) The clergy have an unrivalled opportunity
of taking the lead in educating public
opinion on the subject. In no other religious
body in the world is the ministry of so high
a class, not merely socially (a small matter) but
intellectually, morally, and spiritually, as in
the Anglican Communion. As a result, I know
no body of men better able to come to sane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
and balanced conclusions on any subjects,
the details of which are within their own
experience. They touch life at many points.
Their calling brings them into contact with vast
numbers of people, and they usually show in
their dealings with others a broad-minded
tolerance and shrewd common-sense which is
beyond praise. I do not hesitate to say that, if
I were accused of a crime which I knew I had
not committed, I should feel safer if the trial
were conducted before a jury of Anglican
clergymen than before men drawn from any
other profession; but in this matter of
‘spiritual’ or ‘psychic’ healing they have not
risen to the occasion. An article in the
<i>Church Times</i> of February 18, 1910, lies
before me. A dogmatic gentleman (or lady,
perhaps&mdash;the style is essentially feminine)
writes the most confident nonsense on the
subject of the ‘Gift of Healing’ that ever
filled two columns. Here is an extract, not
by any means the most precious gem from the
entire chaplet, but a fair example of the whole:</p>

<p>‘The gift of healing is simply a human
gift&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like the gift of music or any other gift,
and also, like music, present in some people
more than in others, though probably present
in some degree in nearly everybody.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
gift transcends all knowledge, it cures diseases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
considered incurable. Consumption, cancer,
blindness, deafness, cripples (<i>sic</i>), &amp;c., this is
within our practical experience to-day, so that
it stands to reason that the art of curing by
medicine will gradually disappear as the gift
of healing grows and develops. Not so the
scientific knowledge of the doctors, which
will be used more and more where it ought to
be used, and that is <i>in the prevention of disease</i>.’</p>

<p>Comment would be quite superfluous. But
what follows is instructive. In the next issue
of the <i>Church Times</i> the irrepressible Mr.
Hickson and the ‘Warden of the Guild of
Health’ rush into print with some rather vague
assertions about the ‘spiritual nature’ of this
gift. There is an extremely sensible letter
from a doctor, pointing out with great moderation
that, if there is any evidence for those
confident assertions, he would be glad to know
what it amounted to. No clergyman seems
to have thought it worth his while to disclaim
agreement with the wild statements of the
writer of the article.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, I would appeal to the
clergy to inform themselves as to the limitation
of ‘spiritual healing,’ according to the immense
mass of evidence which has been
collected and does enable us to lay down those
limitations with sufficient accuracy for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
practical purpose of life; and to act as wise
advisers to their people in this matter.</p>

<p>(2) The clergy will do well to remember
that a great deal of bodily <i>ill-health</i> may exist
quite independently of bodily <i>disease</i>. These
cases are commoner than cases of organic
malady. There is plenty of scope for ameliorative
work in connexion with them. At the
risk of being thought egotistical, I may be
allowed to quote a case which recently came
under my own observation, and which is
typical of a large number of others.</p>

<p>A young man, who was clearly very far
from being of a neurotic or hysterical type,
came to me complaining of severe pain in the
region of the heart. It had, according to his
account, been gradually increasing for some
time. It frequently came on after he had run
upstairs, and on one occasion had been intense
after running to catch a train. It was sometimes
accompanied by violent palpitation and
breathlessness, and had no relation to food.
Would I tell him if his heart was all right?
I examined the heart and could find no trace
of any abnormal condition. Nor could I find
any evidence of anything in the abdomen
which would be likely to account for the pain.
I told him that his heart was absolutely sound
and that there appeared to be nothing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
suggest disease anywhere. A rather careful
diet would do him no harm. If it did not do
any good, it would be easy enough to prescribe
a tonic, but I did not think it necessary.
I never expected to see him again. Five
months later, however, he called and explained
with much gravity that he had come to thank
me for ‘curing his heart.’ I then remembered
the case, and was fairly staggered. ‘But bless
my soul,’ I said rather brusquely, ‘there never
was anything the matter with your heart.’
‘No,’ he replied, this time with a quiet smile,
‘I know there wasn’t. All I can say is that
from the time you told me it was all right,
the pain disappeared, and I have never had
any return of it. But, look here, when it was
there, <i>the pain was real</i>.’</p>

<p>I have no doubt it was. To label all such
cases as ‘hysterical,’ ‘neurotic,’ and so on
(in the ordinary connotation of these terms)
is utterly unscientific. This young fellow was
a sensible, cheerful, rather unimaginative youth
without a trace of ‘<i>neurasthenia</i>’ about him.
Yet, by coming to believe that his heart was
diseased, he had quite unconsciously so excited
the higher centres that the vagus nerve returned
exactly the impressions to the brain which
would be conveyed by various morbid organic
conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span></p>

<p>Now, in such a case as this (and the number
of them must be very large indeed) the parish
clergyman has a great scope for quiet, useful
work. Let him urge the patient not to dwell
on his supposed condition, but go at once to
a competent practitioner and find out what
exactly (if anything) is the matter. The
clergyman will find that (if he has the patient’s
consent) the doctor will make no difficulty
about affording him the fullest information
about the physical condition of the patient, and
from their co-operation the happiest results
may be expected.</p>

<p>(3) Conversely, there are many cases where
a sympathetic doctor would be only too glad
to be in touch with a parish clergyman.
Occasionally we get at the hospital a note from
a clergyman, saying that X.&nbsp;Y. is to call at the
Out-Patients’ Department to-day, and that
the writer would be glad to know in confidence
what is the matter with him. I only
wish we had more. If there is no objection
raised by the patient, there is no difficulty
whatever about entering into the fullest particulars,
and in those cases (and they are far
from infrequent) where the patient complains
of ‘worries,’ a sympathetic adviser on the
spot will probably do more to bring about an
improvement in the physical condition than all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
the compounds of iron, strychnine, &amp;c., in
the hospital pharmacopœia. The full consent
of the patient is, of course, an indispensable
preliminary. When this is obtained, the rest
is easy enough.</p>

<p>(4) In the same way, when there is a
suspicion or fairly clear evidence that health is
being undermined by some evil habit, the
sympathetic clergyman, who knows the patient
well, can do far more for him than the most
skilled doctor who has probably only seen him
once or twice. Why any clergyman should
want to babble about a special ‘gift of healing’
in dealing with these most distressing cases,
considering what the evidence on the subject
of a ‘gift of healing’ is, I cannot conceive.
The unostentatious, healthy influence of a
cultured Christian gentleman has a potency
which no manipulation or ritual is in the least
likely to enhance. If he will equip himself
with the necessary information as to the
‘patient’s’ actual physical condition, he can
set to work to exercise his influence, with the
knowledge that he will probably effect more,
so far as a permanent result goes, than all
the self-styled ‘healers’ who ever supported
scientific misstatements with bad logic, or
clouded with frothy verbiage what intellect
they possess.</p>

SICKNESS</h2>
</div>

<div class="auth2"><span class="smcap">By W. Yorke Fausset</span>, M.A.</div>


<p>(1) Men are commonly influenced by actions
and personal example much more powerfully
than by abstract teaching; and the Christian
tradition conforms to this principle in placing
the three Synoptic Gospels in the forefront
of the New Testament. For they set before
us the mind of Christ in the words and acts of
Jesus. Thus when the thoughtful Christian is
asked, ‘What is the Gospel view of disease?’
he will be inclined to reply, ‘The question is a
difficult one, but we may say with some confidence
that our Lord answered it by His
miracles of healing.’ A study of these and
of their underlying principles may help us
towards the definition we seek.</p>

<p>The records are fragmentary. Yet they are
warm with living realism. The great facts of
our Faith stand out before us in the moving
drama of the Synoptic Gospels<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> just as truly as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
they are interpreted for us in the spiritual
Gospel, the Fourth. Jesus Christ is portrayed
as the Son of Man: and whatever else that
most significant title denotes, it speaks to us of
His human activity, His practical and energetic
sympathy with the sins and sorrows of men.
And this activity found its exercise in two
directions: teaching and healing. The association
of the two things is noteworthy, as indicating
a great principle. The sins of mankind
are not unconnected with their sicknesses;
spiritual restoration with bodily relief. A
calm of soul may bring rest to the body.
He who fulfilled in His earthly ministry the
prophetic office was also a ‘Physician of
extraordinary achievement.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> To render Professor
Bousset’s words, though we cannot
reproduce their eloquence:</p>

<p>‘How the simple populace must have hailed
this Deliverer in every time of need! With
what unspeakable confidence they must have
thronged him! At his coming, despair lifted
its head, dull eyes glistened, weary hands
and arms reached forth towards him. They
trusted him for everything, all things became
possible. Body and soul with all their needs
they brought to him for healing. The cries
of need and anguish, the confidence which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
knew no limitations, the craving for help,
the faltering prayer, the shouts or sobs of joy,
the tears of gratitude&mdash;daily he moved in the
midst of it all.’</p>

<p>Are we then to conclude that our Lord
attached no less importance to the cure of
bodily ailment than to the spiritual redemption
of men? Much has been written of late years
which might seem to imply this. But the
whole trend of Christ’s teaching forbids us to
emphasise the value of physical well-being
at the expense of the master claims of the
spirit: witness His words in the Sermon on
the Mount about taking thought for the life
or the body<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> And therefore we must avoid
mere rhetoric and special pleading.</p>

<p>(i) It is plain, at the outset, that our Lord
set certain limits to the exercise of His healing
activity. What has often been said of miracles
in <span class="nowrap">general<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span> may be said of the miracles of
healing. There is a severe economy in the
exercise of such supernatural, or extranatural,
powers. This is illustrated by our Lord’s
apparent reluctance to work miracles when it is
not certain that a true faith asks for it<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span> In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
other words, the receptivity of men is necessary
to the Divine transaction with the sufferer.</p>

<p>Again, He is slow to exercise His power
outside the boundaries of Israel, within which
He was pleased to confine His work of preaching
and healing. Possibly He knew that there He
would be welcomed as a mere wonder-working
magician. He makes it a condition of His
action that the atmosphere should be one of
real faith<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span> He could there do no mighty works
because of their unbelief<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> Was it because of
the waning faith of the multitudes that,
towards the end of His work on earth, the
Healing Ministry almost ceases<span class="nowrap">?<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> Whether
on this account, or in the desire to escape the
demonstrations of popular interest which the
miracles evoked, or because the full evidential
effect of these ‘signs’ was now almost attained,
He restricts His healing, life-giving power to
some four cases, one of them the raising of
Lazarus. For each and all a special reason
can be found<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>(ii) Christ’s healing activity was therefore
strictly limited in scope. It may be asked,
Was it a ‘unique manifestation of a unique
Personality<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span> or did it differ in degree rather
than in kind from the wonderful works of
human healers, or, at all events, of healers who
have wrought ‘in the name of Jesus Christ’?
The latter view by no means commits its
advocates to a ‘humanitarian’ view of the
Person of Jesus Christ: while it amply satisfies
the facts. Again, it is not necessary, for the
purpose of the present discussion, to digress
into the field of New Testament criticism.
Renan, in his ‘Vie de Jésus,’ feels himself
constrained to apologise for the miraculous
action of Christ, on the ground that ‘the rôle of
thaumaturge was unwelcome to him, but was
imposed upon him by his contemporaries.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span>
To Loisy, a critic of profounder learning and
far more reverent temper, it appears that the
miracles were in reality ‘works of mercy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and not a direct argument in favour of the
Messiahship of the Saviour,’ a complexion
which was afterwards put upon them more
or less unconsciously by the Evangelists<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span>
But it is quite consistent with a reverent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
acknowledgment of the Divinity of our Lord,
and an acceptance of the Gospel records in substance
as they stand, to hold that the miracles
of healing&mdash;with the nature-miracles we are
not here concerned&mdash;were the simple outcome
of that all-embracing human pity which, in
itself, betokened the expected Messiah; rather
than an immediate exercise of Almighty power,
and the utterance, within the physical order,
of the Eternal Word. We find our Lord
proclaiming Himself, in the synagogue of
Nazareth, the Fulfiller of that great prophecy
of Isaiah in his sixty-first chapter, in which the
Messianic mission is set forth in language in
which a spiritual and a physical deliverance
are inseparably intertwined<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span> Similarly, in
answer to the Baptist’s message, the same
blending of evangelical teaching and spiritual
healing is to be noticed; and, once again, sin and
disease stand out as the dominant factors in the
condition of this present world.</p>

<p>(iii) But if the source of the miracles is
thus to be sought in the Sacred Humanity, that
Humanity is, after all, the perfect ideal and
norm of all humanity. Whatever exceptional
powers of genius, whatever special faculties
and latent gifts of mind and will have appeared
at rare intervals among men, these we should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
expect to find exemplified, one and all, in the
Life of Christ, had that Life come down to us in
a complete form. Now, it cannot be questioned
that in every age a few individuals have been
found, who were endowed with a preternatural
therapeutic power, connected generally with
a very subtle power of sympathy, but, in some
instances, if we may believe what we are told,
inherent in a person who had no wish whatever
to exercise it<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> That some such virtue resided
in Christ, and accounts for some part of His
healing work, need not be questioned. The
records may be said to imply it in two
passages<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span> that which relates to the act of the
woman who touched the hem of His garment
in the crowd, and that which speaks of this
method of cure as ofttimes repeated. They
besought Him that they might touch if it
were but the border of his garment&mdash;and as
many as touched were made whole.</p>

<p>It is possible, no doubt, to account for such
cures on a purely naturalistic hypothesis,
such as that which <span class="nowrap">Keim<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> accepts, viz. that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
they were cases of faith-healing; a phenomenon
which recurs in connexion with nearly
every form of religious belief, and in every
stage of social development. The influence of
the spiritual imagination on the bodily state
is undeniable. Everyone knows something
about the phenomena of Lourdes and Bethshan,
healing resorts which, theologically speaking,
lie at opposite poles. In a cruder form the
same effects are found in connexion with
holy wells and relics of the saints<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span> We may
go back to the ancients and find wonderful
cures reported in the pagan world, from the
shrines of Asclepius (the patron deity of
physicians). A blind man touches the altar
of Aesculapides (as he was called at Rome)
on the island of the Tiber and receives his
sight<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> The Emperors Hadrian and Vespasian
used to touch for the ‘King’s evil.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span></p>

<p>But can anyone study the miracles of our
Lord as a whole (for we must not lose sight
of those wrought upon inanimate nature) and
feel that they are sufficiently explained by a
familiar truth in psychology, viz. that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
religious imagination is able to stimulate the
bodily forces, whatever may be the spiritual
soil in which that imagination is bred?
Faith, or a conscious receptivity in the mind
of the patient, was a frequent factor in the
healing process; although there is really
nothing in the records to make us predicate
it of Jairus’s daughter or the centurion’s slave
or the nobleman’s son. It is surely remarkable
that our Lord held Himself aloof from all those
methods of cure which might have suggested
the enchanter and magician, particularly in
the case of demoniacs. The Jews, like other
ancient nations, resorted to the use of exorcism,
incantation, and talismans, which owed their
potency to their effect on the imagination.
Christ does not hypnotise men or throw them
into an ecstasy. Where faith is present, He
gladly works through it towards the salvation
of the whole man. But often there is a mere
flicker of faith, a spark in the flax. In the
sick room, when the vital forces are enfeebled,
the brain clouded, and the spirits depressed
by physical malady, it is a rare thing, surely,
for the flame of faith to burn brightly and the
imagination to glow with the consciousness
of an unseen Presence. And the Church
would have but little encouragement to invoke
for her own ministries the healing Power of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
Master, if it could only be enlisted on behalf
of such patients as already possessed ‘comfort
and sure confidence in their Lord.’ We believe
that the Church has something less elusive to
offer her people in their hour of need: and we
return to the records of Christ’s miracles in
order to discover it.</p>

<p>(iv) The value of what is called ‘mental
therapeutics’ is no longer contested; it receives,
and has received for some time, the
careful attention of the medical profession<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span>
We approach the subject from the religious
standpoint, we base our study of it upon the
teaching and practice of Jesus Christ. Accordingly,
we must discriminate between psychic
treatment and spiritual treatment. The former
term, if applicable to religious treatment, can
also denote forms of mental cure which are
unconnected with religion, e.g. the use of
hypnotism. But Christ addresses Himself to
the Spirit (πνευμα), that highest element of our
nature, through which the mystics hold that we
have kinship with God, and in unison with which
the Holy Spirit attests our Divine sonship.
His miracles are works of <i>spiritual</i> healing, they
are wrought for the whole man, not only for
soul, and certainly not only for body. Christ’s
view of healing is relative to His view of disease,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
His view of disease to His view of human
nature. Had he attached to bodily health
the supreme importance which it is the
tendency of our day to assign to it, and
regarded bodily pain as a thing at all costs
to be effaced, we must suppose that His
whole Life upon earth would have been devoted
to the relief of sickness and pain, and that the
‘Healing Ministry’ of His Church would have
been far more clearly defined. But no more
does He abolish disease than He abolishes
pauperism. The tendency of His teaching is
to inculcate self-sufficingness (the αὐταρκεία,
of St. <span class="nowrap">Paul<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> and the Greek philosophers) in the
face of all temporary evils and ailments, the
conquest of things material by the spirit, its
supremacy in the hierarchy of human nature;
in a word, the principle of inner control or
autonomy, as the birthright of the human
spirit. In his great picture of the Transfiguration,
Raphael has caught this contrast
between the calm of the heavenly Mount above
and the ineffective, agonised distraction of
suffering humanity here below, in the person
of the lunatic boy and his father. But that
heavenly calm of spirit is not the self-centred
aloofness of the Stoic. The doctrine of the
Incarnation brings the Divine Saviour down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
to men, lifts man up to the peace of heaven<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span>
and at the same time bids him find that peace
in fulfilling the bodily duties of his corporate
Church life. It will not admit of a selfish
quietism. But before this peace of God which
Christ proclaims, the worry and ‘fear-thought’
of our overstrung modern age, its neurotic
sensationalism and morbid self-analysis, would
retire abashed. Christ would teach us that
human nature is itself only when it is itself in
its completeness, when the physical is truly
the instrument of the spiritual. There is no
dualism, no schism in human nature as
Divinely planned. The voluptuary and the
ascetic are both at fault, the former more
so because he sins against the higher self.
Christ is the Saviour of the whole man, and to
the sick He restores ‘perfect soundness,<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> nor
does He refuse to be called the Saviour of the
body<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span></p>

<p>(v) It is a significant fact that in the Gospels
the word for ‘save’ (σῴζειν) is applied
to bodily as well as spiritual salvation; it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
denotes ‘to restore to health or sanity.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span> A
protest may here be entered against the very
prevalent opinion that God sent sickness upon
man, by an Almighty fiat, in order to discipline
him into patience and other Christian virtues.
Such a view, crudely stated, has led to much
perplexity and distress of faith, and it is not
warranted by the teaching of the New Testament.
God can bring good out of evil, even
in its worst forms. But that is not to say that
God by a deliberate act designs and causes
evil. More than once in the New Testament
sickness is attributed to Satanic agency, in the
case of ‘the woman which had a spirit of
infirmity eighteen years,<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span> and in that of St.
Paul’s ‘thorn in the flesh.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> Disease is a
disturbance of the balance of human powers,
mental and bodily, a derangement of faculties
and functions. Consider the bearing of this
upon life. Modern science teaches us the
doctrine of the persistence of matter; in Sir
Oliver Lodge’s words, ‘a really existing
thing never perishes, but only changes its
form’&mdash;in the case of our complex human
constitution, that change of form is what we
call death. It is vital force which maintains
that inner harmony which we call health: it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
is disease, an accident, which impairs it. This
derangement and discord is but one instance
of that general disturbance of the world’s
harmony which sin has introduced. Sometimes,
as in the case of the impotent man of
St. John v., disease is the direct consequence
of sinful conduct. It is the work of the Son
of Man to restore harmony and repair the
breaches in Nature’s order. And this His
healing power on its spiritual, which is its
essential, side effects. Incidentally, miracles
are ‘signs,’ evidences of the Christian Revelation,
but their primary character is that
of ‘mighty works’ (δυνάμεις), particular manifestations
of that Power (δύναμις) which resides
in the Person of the Lord. As such they
impressed King Herod, though he attributed
their authorship to the Baptist risen from the
dead<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span></p>

<p>(vi)   This Healing Power of Christ stands
in closest relation to His claim to be ‘the
Life of them that believe and the Resurrection
from the dead.’ It flows from His Personality.
Though that Personality is veiled for us in
profound mystery, we know that in It the
Human will and the Divine will are in perfect
accord; and, therefore, it does not surprise
us that, while a place is found in the Saviour’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
Life upon earth for weariness and pain, none
is found for sickness; for, in all things, He
conformed to the Will of God for man, which is
health, not sickness. Sickness is a violation of
that normal condition which God has appointed
for man. When infection and disease entered
into the world, we must believe that they were
part of that general imperfection which God
can only be said to will as a means to an end,
or as a passing stage in the evolution of good.
God does not send sickness to scourge us, but
overrules it to purge us. In saying this, we
need not deny the possible place of death in a
perfect cosmos; a death which should have been
the gradual ebbing of physical vitality, not
its sapping and undermining by the malignant
forces of disease. We should expect, then, that
our Lord’s healing power would be the action
of the life-giving Spirit of God upon the spirit
of man, from the very fact that in Christ man
was brought into living contact with God.</p>

<p>Recent psychology, especially in the investigations
of Professor W. James and the
late F.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;H. Myers, has thrown a new light
upon those recesses of human nature in which
our religious experiences take place. We have
learned that there is a subconscious self,
a submerged portion of our faculties, which
responds to spiritual impressions and accepts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
those suggestions of a Higher Power, to which
mind and intellect are sometimes deaf, a
‘subliminal self,<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span> in which religious faith and
the inspirations of genius are alike rooted,
and which is <i>en rapport</i> with another world
than that of the senses. We are reminded of
Tennyson’s words:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Moreover, something is or seems,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That touches me with mystic gleams,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like glimpses of forgotten dreams&mdash;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Of something done, I know not where<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>It is through that under-self that mental
cures appear to operate<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span></p>

<p>The theory certainly contributes something
to our problem, making it conceivable, even
to our finite intelligence, how the Divine Life
of Christ should enter into man, sick of body
and sad of soul, and this quite in the line of the
order and natural law of God’s universe. Christ
is one with the Father; He came down from
Heaven to do the will of the Father; His works
are done in the Father’s name (John x. 25).
The Father hath given the Son to have life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
in Himself (John v. 26). The Divine Life is
communicated to those who seek it in Christ.
We are not to restrict the thought of that Life
to the immaterial part of our nature; it is the
more abundant life which floods the being
of him who ‘liveth unto God.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span> We may not
fathom its hidden processes: like spiritual
teaching, spiritual healing can come home
only to the ‘spiritual men’ whose minds are
‘in tune with the Infinite.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span> But some desire
for ‘more life and fuller’ is found in every man.
Classical scholars will remember the pathetic
lines written by the statesman Mæcenas in his
last illness:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Debilem facito manu,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Debilem pede, coxa&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vita dum superest, bene est<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>In this universal fact of human nature, this
desire to live, which varies infinitely among
men from the mere craving of animal existence
up to the desire for the life in God, we see man’s
response to the Giver of Life.</p>

<p>The appeal of the Good Physician is to
human nature, and ‘He knows what is in man.’
He takes a natural emotion or faculty, vitalises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
and invigorates it. We have had to keep
the connexion of spiritual health and physical
health constantly before us. There is a
parallelism between them which is no mere
analogy, but is a sort of pre-established
harmony; and therefore a wise interpretation
of Scripture has seen in the Miracle an ‘acted
parable.’ Thus it is in regard to the ‘desire
to live’ which supports our bodily vitality.
This categorical imperative or instinctive
‘ought’ of health is a primary instinct. The
‘will to be well’ corresponds with the ‘will
to be good’ which is the basis of the moral
life.</p>

<p>(2) Bearing these principles in mind, we
must turn to a closer examination of some
of the miracles, with a view to some practical
conclusions in regard to the healing office of the
Church of our own day.</p>

<p>(i) Has the age of miracles long ceased?
It has long been assumed by religious minds,
as a kind of axiomatic truth, that this is so.
They have seen in the healing miracles of
Christ the unique exercise of a power specifically
Divine, a power which was continued for
a time, with other extraordinary gifts, to the
early Church for reasons which no longer held
good when once she had taken firm root in the
world. But we have already shown reasons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
for the opinion that, unique as is our Lord’s
Humanity, we are to regard it as conditioned
by those laws of nature and material existence
which are the expression in the visible sphere
of the Creative will. ‘It behoved Him in all
things to be made like unto His brethren.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span>
And there is strong reason to hold that the
true believer will be permitted, in virtue of
his fellowship with Christ, to do ‘greater
works’ than those which Christ Himself
wrought<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span> greater, that is to say, not in a
material but a spiritual way. That the works
in question were wrought ‘in the spirit’ is
unquestioned. Consider what those ‘spiritual’
methods of the Great Healer were. He
wrought His mighty works in the Father’s
name. Not only does He lay down for others
the principle of intercessory prayer, but as
Man He exercises it Himself. Of the demoniac
boy He says: ‘This kind goeth forth not but
by prayer and fasting.’ St. Luke records
the fact that He made the importunity of the
multitude, who sought His teaching and healing
grace, a fresh occasion for retirement and
prayer<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span> The same Gospel tells us of a night
spent in prayer before the election of the Twelve
Apostles<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span> They received His commission to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
heal and to teach on the succeeding day,
which saw also the vast concourse of people
resorting to Him once more from all quarters.
In the account of the raising of Lazarus it
is clearly laid down that Jesus Christ knew
the Father’s will in virtue of fellowship with
Him in prayer and meditation, and that
He exercised His own life-giving powers in
accordance with that Will.</p>

<p>Health in itself is an ideal, the perfect
harmony of all the elements, the spiritual and
the material, which constitutes a man. One
of the greatest living authorities writes:
‘Health, like every other such name, is to be
used in a relative sense; absolute health is an
ideal conception.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span> This being so, it is apparent
to any religious mind that the true concept of
the well-being, physical and even mental, of
any person is only to be found in the Mind
of God. And that is only an abstract way
of saying that, if we follow Christ’s example,
we shall seek to enter into His fellowship
with the Father. In that Divine fellowship
we shall be able to pray for the true health
and recovery of our sick people. ‘The prayer
of faith shall save the sick,’ for faith implies
a whole-hearted acceptance of the Will of God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
for the uncertain future. This gives a man
the tranquillity of soul which is no less needed
for prayer than for action. Such an one
possesses his own soul. Our Lord promises
to those, who ‘have faith and doubt not,<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span> that
they shall ‘remove mountains,’ a hyperbolic
expression, but yet one which seems to claim
a certain power of acting upon inanimate
nature<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span> Such a power need not carry with it
a positive breach of cosmic law. It is impossible
for any really reverent mind to wish,
even in the supposed interest of his dearest
friend, to bend the Will of God to his own
desire. Such a rash prayer involves the fatal
flaw of that ‘doubting mind’ which is forbidden
us, the mind ‘divided’ between God
and self. The spirit which unites us to God,
that unfathomed inner self, desires the universal
good.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Our wills are ours, we know not how:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our wills are ours, to make them Thine.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>God wills the true health and salvation of each
human soul, as He alone can view it, in its
relation both to the vast whole of immaterial
being and to the order of the material universe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
‘His will He knoweth which way to accomplish.’
Prayer is the act of resignation of our
individual desires and thoughts into His all-wise
hands. Prayer universalises a personal
longing; and so wonderful is the magic of
true prayer, fetching up from the deep of our
being suggestions, inspirations, forces unperceived
by man, that it can never fail to
induce a sense of calm, the most favourable
for a physical recovery; and many a time it
has effectuated that recovery itself. Science
may teach the ‘reflex action of prayer’;
religion will always find authentic answers to
prayer.</p>

<p>Prayer is the spiritual instrument on which
our Lord in His Human Nature relies, and on
which He encourages His Church to rely&mdash;‘a
mighty engine of achievement.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span> His method
was grounded in prayer, the prayer of that
Divine fellowship, which is His, as it cannot
belong to any of the sons of men, and yet in
Him, ‘in the Name of Christ,’ the Church
must still expect to accomplish the miracles
of faith, in proportion to the degree of her own
spirituality. Who, indeed, would have looked
for miracles of healing in the English Church
of the eighteenth century, unless it were among
the non-jurors, who actually revived the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
apostolic rite of unction<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span> and the pious followers
of John Wesley<span class="nowrap">?<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span></p>

<p>(ii) But that spiritual power, thus resident
in the Healer, has to communicate itself to
the subjects of His grace; subjects they must
be rather than objects. And His first purpose
is to excite the dormant energies of life and
action. He does it as a wise physician will
do it, by concentrating the patient’s mind
upon Himself<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span> This is done by a question,
or other means, adapted, with His profound
insight into character, to the individual case.
In the case of the deaf man who had an impediment,
He effected this by isolating him<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span>
and then using physical means (with finger and
saliva). Exactly parallel is the case of the
blind man, which, like the former, is recorded
by St. Mark alone<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span> He asks blind Bartimæus,
‘What wilt thou that I should do unto
thee?<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span> And this is one of several cases in
which the sovereign faculty of will leaps forth,
and the confession of faith attends it<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span> In
the cure of the lame man by St. Peter (in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
Acts iii. 4, 5) this concentration of the thought
of the patient upon the healer is reciprocal
(ἀτενίσας&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ἐπει̑χεν).</p>

<p>The tonic influence of a healthy personality
upon the hysterical, neurotic, and mentally
diseased, not to speak of minds depressed in
a normal way, is familiar to everyone. In
Dinah Morris’s visit of comfort to the widowed
Lisbeth, we have a sample of that subtlest
perception and ‘subduing influence of the
spirit’ which we may call inspiration<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span> In
the New Testament it appears at its highest in
treatment of those strong cases of dual personality,
mental disorder, or hysteria, which we
know as demoniacal possession. We cannot
here discuss the question, whether the sufferer
was the victim of the lower elements in
his own nature or of a malignant outside influence
(known in the language of the day as a
‘demon’). On the other hand, it has to be
remembered that the Jews personified ordinary
diseases; and our Lord conformed to popular
ideas when ‘He rebuked the fever’ of Simon’s
wife’s mother, unless we hold that the
evangelist has coloured the record of His
action by his own mentality<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span> On the other
hand, we know little as yet of the psycho<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>logical
problems of civilised humanity and
less of those of half-civilised or uncivilised
peoples, such as the Galileans of our Lord’s
day. But if we should allow that the demon
was merely the sufferer’s lower ego, the marvel
of the cure is not lessened. There is a great
power of evil in the world; and the lower
self was entirely dominated by it until Christ
emancipated the man by His sovereign demand
upon his spirit. Inner harmony was restored.
They find the man ‘sitting at the feet of
Jesus, clothed and in his right mind.’ The
bodily and the mental well-being are combined
in the cure. The sufferer’s enfeebled will is
braced up to respond to the Will of the Healer,
that ease shall expel disease. Within the
man’s being, as truly as without it, ‘imperavit
ventis, et facta est tranquillitas magna.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span></p>

<p>(iii) An analysis of the miracles of Christ
indicates His attitude towards the material and
outward means, on which the physician still
so largely relies. The letter of King Abgarus
to our Lord (preserved by Eusebius), genuine
or not, indicates, we may believe, the feature
in His treatment which most impressed the
men of His day. ‘The story hath reached
my ears of Thee and Thy healings as wrought
by Thee without drugs and simples.’ Though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
this was so, He did not eschew the use of
material and visible signs, such as clay and
saliva, which were adapted to convey to sick
folk that ‘mental suggestion’ of returning
health, which was His constant method of
healing. In the following miracles the use
of such material means is recorded: the case
of the deaf man with an impediment (Mark vii.
33), of the blind man at Bethsaida (Mark viii.
24), of the man blind from his birth (John ix.
6), who also was sent to wash in the pool of
Siloam. Of the Apostles, on their first mission,
it is said that they anointed with oil many
that were sick, and healed them (Mark vi. 13).
Probably this element, which was in frequent
medicinal use, was in their hands ceremonial,
a symbol of that healing power of their Master
which they were allowed in His name to
exercise. He Himself is found, in the great
majority of instances, to rely on the touch of
the hand alone<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span> He knew that it spoke to
the heart of a Divine effluence of power as
well as a human sympathy. In one of the
frescoes of the Creation, on the roof of the
Sistine Chapel, Michelangelo has pictured the
form of the first man, perfect as a statue, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
lifeless until the Finger of God quickens it
with a touch. And, after all, a universal
instinct associates ideas of sympathy and
positive relief with the movement of the hand.
Thus in the Greek myth, the distracted Io
is comforted by the prophecy of Prometheus
that the God would restore her by his
touch<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span></p>

<p>(iv) The healing of the nobleman’s son, of
the centurion’s slave, and that of the Syrophœnician
woman’s daughter stand by themselves
as instances of ‘absent treatment.’
The strong impression wrought in the mind
of the father, the master, the mother, respectively,
is conveyed by a sort of telepathy to the
mind of the patient. ‘Why herein,’ surely,
is a marvellous thing for those who cannot
accept our Lord’s claim to be the Son of Man
in a unique sense&mdash;that He should thus have
possessed, 2000 years ago, a knowledge of the
mysterious processes of human nature which
modern science is only now beginning to
divine. It is in that fact that the ‘glory’
(Luke xiii. 17; John xi. 40), the ‘wonder’
(Matt. xxi. 15), the ‘strangeness’ (Luke v. 26)
of the miracles of Christ consist. They are
‘works of power,<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></span> ‘outcomings of that mighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
power of God which was inherent in Christ,<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></span>
and which He exerted within a region of
human nature then unexplored. We cannot
ponder too deeply on that great saying of
St. Augustine, ‘Portentum fit non contra
naturam, sed contra quam est nota natura.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span>
Who shall attempt to lay down the laws which
govern the operation of the spiritual upon
the material? and still more to delimit the
powers of the Personality and Will of Him, in
whose name Apostles, Saints of the Church,
and humble Christians unrecorded in history
have wrought cures, which only a purblind
scepticism can gainsay?</p>

<p>The psychologists teach us that a man’s
‘self’ is a larger thing than the ‘me’ which,
we might say, a child has in view when it puts
out a hand to get a sweetmeat for itself. As
Professor W. James says, ‘The old saying
that the human person is composed of three
parts&mdash;soul, body, and clothes&mdash;is more than
a joke’; and he goes on to include in that self
the man’s immediate family, his home, the
property he has collected<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span> And then we
think of Aristotle’s definition of man as a
‘political’ or social animal&mdash;the social self
with its wider or narrower reach&mdash;for ‘properly
speaking a man has as many social selves as
there are individuals who recognise him.’</p>

<p>(i) All this has an important bearing on the
subject of health and disease. We are all
influenced by our environment for better or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
worse. The material and visible conditions
of life, our home, our friends and associates,
our country, our daily occupations, contribute
to make us what we are. Life is defined by
Herbert Spencer as ‘the continuous adjustment
of internal relations.’ It may be difficult
or even impossible to attain to the stable
equilibrium of perfect goodness, perfect health,
perfect happiness; and, in fact, neither science
nor religion encourage us to expect such a
consummation within the limits of this earthly
existence.</p>

<p>But there may be a ‘continuous adjustment’;
and it must be the practical aim alike
of religion and of science to mould the individual
by the environment which will best
harmonise his personal good with the good of
the whole. We have to elevate the conditions
of human existence. The individual
has not only to adapt himself to his environment,
in the temper of <i>laisser faire</i>, but to
adapt it to the satisfaction of his highest good.
‘Great religious consciences have taken their
post, confronting society, as representing in
themselves truth and right, because behind
them was God, while behind existing societies
there is only man, nature, and circumstances.
Far from consenting to identify himself with
the social conscience, the religious conscience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
disposes man to oppose the rights of God to
those of Cæsar, the dignity of the human
person to public constraint.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></span> In the language
of religion, ‘No man hath seen God at any
time: if we love one another, God dwelleth
in us, and His love is perfected in us.’ That is
the ideal of the Christian Society, the Body of
Christ, actuated by the great principles of faith,
hope, and love. And much might have been
said of the duty of a Christian State to secure
to all its members the elementary conditions
of a healthy, useful citizenship. Most of our
disease is a disgrace to our Christian civilisation,
because it is preventable. The ancient
poet rightly associates the spectres of Care,
Hunger, and Fear with the grim forms of
Disease at the portals of his Inferno:</p>

<p>(ii)   But the problem of the prevention of
sickness scarcely concerns us here, though it
requires a passing reference. It has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
sufficiently shown that you cannot isolate the
individual from the society in which he moves;
that were to make him an unreal abstraction.
The Church has never committed that mistake
in her dealing with the sick. When we pray,
in the Office for the Visitation of the Sick,
that God would ‘preserve and continue this
sick member in the unity of the Church,’ the
prayer breathes the very spirit of ancient
piety. It is an unspeakable help, in dealing
with a sick man, to be able to appeal to his
own conscious and sincere membership in
the Body of Christ. The Visitation Office is
‘peculiarly a ministration for those who have
been trained beforehand in the fulness of
Church life and privileges.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></span> Herein, as often,
the Prayer-book sets up an ideal standard.
But, however far our actual practice falls
short of it, we must work towards it. It is
said of St. Francis of Assisi that, ‘in each one,
with whom he had to deal, he saw a possible
Christ.’ A bold saying, had it not been that
the Master Himself had anticipated it<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span> In
the Christian view of things, the sick and
suffering, whatever their religious attainments
and professions may have been, have a clear
claim upon the other members of the One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
Body. Christian faith can only heighten
human sympathy.</p>

<p>And in the New Testament there are not
wanting indications that the faith of friends
has a vicarious efficacy. In such faith the
force of suggestion is at work, but it is a
collective suggestion. There is the typical
case of the four friends, who were not to be
put off by the crush at the doors, but resolutely
stripped the roofing in order to lower
the paralytic, as he lay on his pallet, into
the Saviour’s immediate presence. Such unconventional
faith was irresistible. ‘When
Jesus saw their faith, He said unto the sick
of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span>
The bodily cure soon followed. The fact is,
that such faith diffuses a spiritual atmosphere;
it is contagious and works from mind to mind.
‘Our bodies isolate us, our spirits unite us.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span></p>

<p>Similarly, in the raising of Jairus’s daughter
an emphasis is laid on the necessity of a
sympathetic atmosphere: first, by the fact that
only three, the elect among the chosen Twelve,
SS. Peter, James and John, were allowed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
attend their Lord; secondly, by the exclusion
of all others in the house, except the father
and mother of the child. The professional
mourners and musicians were turned out&mdash;not
merely because they ‘insulted the dumbness
of sincere sorrow and the patient majesty
of death’ (Farrar), but because they diffused, as
their behaviour soon showed (κατεγέλων αὐτου̑),
an atmosphere of unbelief. The Lord wishes
to remove all antagonistic and disturbing
human presences and to speak Himself in power
to the innermost soul of the departed maiden.
On the other hand, if the air was charged with
unbelief, if those He wished to help were
without faith, as was the case in His own
village of Nazareth, ‘He could there do no
mighty work.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span></p>

<p>We trace the same principle in His dealing
with those whom He had healed. Sometimes
He bids them ‘go and tell their friends how
great things God has done for them,’ as when
he refused to keep the Gadarene demoniac by
His side. At another time he bids them
tell no man of the cure which had been
wrought. This difference of treatment can
be explained most simply, if we suppose that
in the one case Christ knew that the
patient’s ordinary <i>milieu</i> was favourable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
his progress in bodily and spiritual health, in
another case He knew that this was not so.
So it was in the case of the leper of St.
Mark i. 44. And, again, this difference of
treatment may have been ‘grounded,’ as
Archbishop Trench says, ‘on the different
moral conditions of the persons healed.’ It
is so still, for human nature remains constant
to certain broad types. Some overwrought
people require the absolute isolation of a ‘rest
cure’; others, who are moody and self-centred,
can only rally their disused powers in contact
with invigorating companionship. They are
the unhappy victims of that numbness of
spirit of which R.&nbsp;L. Stevenson writes so
pathetically in his essay entitled ‘Ordered
South.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span></p>

<p>(iii) This brings us naturally to consider
the special value which Christ attaches in His
teaching to a corporate act of prayer. For
this is the meaning of the words ‘If any two
of you shall agree on earth as touching anything
that they shall ask, it shall be done for them
of my Father which is in Heaven; for where
two or three are gathered together in My
Name, there am I in the midst of them.’
And this it is which has moulded the form
of the Lord’s Prayer, and that of the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
Sacrament of Unity, our highest act of intercession.
Thus our Lord enjoined upon His disciples
the duty and the efficacy of combined
spiritual effort<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span> There is a power intensive, as
well as extensive, in collective prayer. In this,
as well as in other activities of the spirit, the
total effect gained is larger than the sum
total of units of effort. There is a sort of
analogy here with the force of collective
suggestion, which we have been considering
above: but we must not expect to find a
complete philosophical explanation of any
great spiritual principle. Our personal experience
verifies the value of corporate prayer.
If it were not so, religion would be an individual
matter alone; it would lack its most universal
expression, that of common worship. It is
because the Church in our country lost for a
long period her corporate consciousness, at
least in a large degree, that she lost sight of the
power of corporate intercession for the sick
members of the Body of Christ. (Of the faithful
departed we may not here speak.) But her
formulas and liturgy have been a standing
witness against such obliviousness, with which
the Church of to-day can hardly be taxed, and
those who profess their belief in the Communion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
of Saints find in such intercession its most
practical expression.</p>

<p>Consider the bearing of all this on our
highest act of worship, the Holy Communion.
There are few parish priests who cannot
testify from their own experience to the
wonderful&mdash;if not miraculous&mdash;effects of the
reception of the Sacrament upon apparently
dying persons, who had been given up by
medical science. There is nothing in this that
need surprise the Christian believer, nothing
that is really repugnant to the findings of
modern science. The Apostle Paul, writing to
the Corinthians about the profanation of the
Lord’s Supper, attributes to this cause certain
physical consequences incurred by the offenders.
‘For this cause many among you are weak
and sickly, and not a few sleep.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span> There is a
natural and proper antipathy in many minds
to the idea that the Sacramental Elements
operate as a charm. Such an idea would be
irrational and superstitious, and we are not
intended to conceive of a vindication of the
sanctity of the Lord’s Supper by material
and simply magical penalties. The offence of
the Corinthians was the irreverence of ‘not
discerning (or discriminating) the Body,’
and Apostolic teaching plainly implies that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
a spiritual offence of itself acts upon the
bodily organism, by a mysterious law of the
Divine government<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></span> (Here again we must not
say that God sent the disease.) Surely, then,
it may be argued, per contra, that a reverent
reception of the Eucharist makes for health and
life, for it brings the failing bodily and spiritual
powers of the sick into contact with the
Divine and immortal life which animates the
mystical Body of Christ. This line of argument
may be illustrated by the words of the
late F.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;H. Myers: ‘To keep our chemical
energy at work, we live in a warm environment
and from time to time take food. By analogy,
in order to keep the spiritual energy at work,
we should live in a spiritual environment,
and possibly from time to time absorb some
special influx of spiritual life.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span> It remains
only to add that the words of administration
in our Communion Office embody the truth for
which we are pleading. ‘The Body of our
Lord Jesus Christ, which was given for thee,
preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting
life.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

<p>(iv) The charisma, or gift, of healing, is
named by St. Paul among the spiritual gifts
of the Apostolic Church<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span> and is associated
in one place with the working of miracles
(‘powers’)<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></span> We have endeavoured to show
that it was not intended as a transient but
a permanent endowment of the Church. But,
in the degree in which the Church corporate
falls short in spirituality, her spiritual powers
wane. The Encyclical Letter and Report of
the recent Lambeth Conference mark a step
in advance, though it may not be a long step,
towards the revival of this healing agency
of the Church. The Committee appointed to
report on this particular subject was of opinion
‘that the prayers for the restoration of health,
which it recommends, may be fitly accompanied
by the apostolic act of the Laying-on-of-Hands.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span>
We may be disposed to regret that
this primitive rite is not mentioned in Resolution
35, which recommends ‘the provision for
use in Pastoral Visitation of some additional
prayers for the restoration of health more
hopeful and direct than those contained in the
present Office for the Visitation of the Sick.’
Desiring, as we do, to follow ‘the example’
of our Lord Himself and not merely of ‘His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
Holy Apostles,<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></span> we may most reasonably ask
for authority to administer the blessing through
one of the outward signs which He employed.
A ceremony, duly authorised by the Church,
would have much value, as regulating and
controlling the impulse to invoke the healing
‘charisma,’ which at present is often bestowed
and received through ‘spiritual healers’
who lack the full official sanction of the
Church.</p>

<p>(v) There is another Ministry of Healing,
which the Divine Love has provided for the
weary body and the careworn mind, which
contributes its own part to the restoration of
the sick. It is the silent ministry of Nature.
Within the ailing body she exerts her healing
power; the doctor’s best ally, on the physical
side, is the <i>vis medicatrix naturae</i>, that
strange recuperative power which resides in
organisms, and offers a standing resistance
to the inroads of disease and age<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span> And then
outside there are the soothing influences of the
world of Nature, which steals into the troubled
spirit to bring the calm which Wordsworth, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
his poem on ‘An Evening by the Sea,’ likened
to the hush of worship:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The holy time is quiet as a nun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Breathless with adoration.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hebrew literature shows little trace, even
indirectly, of that sympathy with Nature,
which is the best contribution of what is
called ‘natural religion’ to the inheritance of
the human spirit, except when Nature is
regarded in her grander and more awe-inspiring
aspects, those of the thunder-cloud, the
whirlwind, the raging fire, the roaring sea.
Yet it is not altogether fanciful to find, in our
Lord’s habit of retirement to the mountain’s
side for prayer, His invitation to the disciples
to come apart by themselves to rest awhile in
a ‘desert place,<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span> His choice of the evening
hour, at the setting of the sun, for performing
His works of mercy, some sanction for that
modern sense of the Divine beauty and
mystery of Nature in her quiet aspects<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span></p>

<p>We must believe that Christ Himself was
susceptible in a singular degree to those
natural influences. After the intense spiritual
strain of the Temptation, ‘angels came and
ministered to Him.’ A great modern artist,
M. Tissot, pictures the scene as only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
imaginative symbolism of genius would have
done. The Saviour lies at full length, utterly
exhausted, with every muscle, as it were,
relaxed, and through the twilight appear
myriads of outstretched angel-hands, reviving
the Sacred Body with the touch of spirit-life.
Here we have, as in a figure, the expression of
the unseen forces of Nature, ministering to the
Will of the God of Nature, on behalf of the
heirs of salvation and of Him who is the author
of our salvation and the Prince of Life.</p>

<p>There is no rule absolute about the influence
of familiar scenes and old associations upon
the weary or ailing spirit. For some people
the cure lies in surroundings as novel and
unfamiliar as possible. This is where tact
and sympathy on the part of the doctor and
nurse and friends come in&mdash;questions which
must not be confused with natural affection,
for in that case they would vary directly,
whereas they have been known to vary
inversely, with nearness of blood relationship.
The quick intuition of sympathy can judge
of the environment best adapted to the
patient’s individual need. The rigid order and
routine of the hospital ward may be torture
to the sick person who comes from one sort
of home and paradise to one who comes
from another. The more we can bring of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
‘mind of Christ’ into the tender care of the
sick, the more right we shall have to expect
that the power of His name will bless our
efforts.</p>

<p>(vi) Again, our Lord’s attention to details,
i.e. the material conditions of health, calls for
notice. We have referred to His provision
of rest for His tired followers. We find Him
giving directions, after the recall of Jairus’s
daughter to life, that food should be given to
her. ‘Life restored by miracle must be supported
by ordinary means.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></span> The familiar
routine of healthy life is to be resumed as
soon as possible. Lazarus is to be loosed from
his cerements, when the awe of the bystanders
blind them to the practical and obvious. And
quite in line with this is Christ’s readiness
to conform, in His dealings with men, to the
existing social and religious system. It was
so notably in the case of the leper, who was
bidden, after his cure, to go and show himself
to the priest and to make the customary
offerings<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></span> At the pool of Bethesda Christ
helps the impotent man, who has no friend
to help him. He leaves the rest of the
multitude to the natural operation of the
waters<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span> It was a different matter when, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
in the case of the Rabbinical rule of Sabbath
observance, the conventional practice was
inimical to the freedom of the spirit. Our
Lord will never allow the spiritual and essential
in things to be overlaid by the material and
accidental. Traditionalism was then broken
through. The principle, that we must render
to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s and
to God the things that are God’s, manifests
itself in various ways, and this is one of them.
But, on the whole, Christianity knows no
revolutionary breaches in the established social
order, as the history of its attitude towards
the institution of slavery shows. Men were
encouraged to work out their own salvation
under existing political and social conditions.</p>

<p>This spirit of conformity to the existing
order in all lawful things, and especially our
Lord’s attitude towards priestly ceremonial,
in the case of the leper, throws a good deal of
light upon the relation which should subsist
between the clergyman and the doctor in the
treatment of sickness. The Christian doctor
will gladly subscribe to the words of the
favourite physician of Louis XIV, Ambroise
Paré, ‘I treated the wound, God healed it.’
Reverently and thoughtfully he will acknowledge
the power of prayer and the tranquillising
influences of the spirit, and will yield to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
Church, acting by her representative duly
accredited and trained, her proper part in the
work of restoration. The parish priest will
freely allow that the doctor and the nurse, with
all the appliances of modern medical science,
provide the largest part of the environment
and conditions indispensable to recovery;
and that it is an act of presumption to reject
all these scientific aids in favour of some
process of healing by faith alone without
expert medical aid<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, it must be remembered that we
cannot expect to find many favourable notices
of medical practice in an age and country in
which medical skill was at a very low ebb.
‘Medicorum optimus dignus est Gehenna,’
said the Rabbis of the later Judaism<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></span> In
nothing has human knowledge made more
astonishing strides than in medical and in
surgical discovery; and, though we have been
too prone in the past to credit the medical
profession with the whole of the healing work
done in Christ’s Church, the opposite extreme
is to be avoided, and it is well to acknowledge
thankfully that ‘discoveries in the region of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
medicine and surgery come to man through
Him who is the Light and the Life, the Divine
Word.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></span></p>

<p>(vii) In a previous chapter we dwelt
at some length on the Gospel conception of
salvation (as illustrated by the words σῴζειν
ὁλοκληρία), as a just equipoise of spiritual,
mental, and physical faculties and functions.
Two remarks may find a place here. The
first is, that too much stress may be laid upon
the distinction between functional and organic
complaints. There are modern critics who
wish to eliminate the miraculous from the
Gospel narrative, and deal with the sacred
text accordingly. For example, Professor
Bousset says, in his vivid way, ‘The community
of the faithful drew the simple human
picture of Jesus on the golden background
of the marvellous. But the picture can be
detached from that background with comparative
ease.’ In cases which are not to be
explained simply by psychology, ‘the historically
intelligible is still close below the surface,
and appears as soon as we remove a few
additions which are due to modern tradition.’
We have to regard certain narratives as
‘legendary accretions (<i>Wucherungen</i>).’</p>

<p>If we cannot accept that position, it is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
open to us to explain all the miraculous agency
of our Lord and His Apostles and the later
Church as consisting in the power to deal with
functional ailments by mental or psychic treatment.
Nor is it open to us to limit the efficacy
of prayer to the stimulation of function and the
treatment of nervous disorders. And as, with
the progress of medical science, the sphere
of the organic is continually growing at the
expense of the functional, the ultimate effect
of such a concession on the side of religion
would be to limit her action to a negligible
minority of cases. How would a place be
found for the healing of Malchus’s ear, if the
organic be excluded? But the Church believes
that Christ is the Saviour of the body and that
the Holy Spirit is, as an early Father says,
‘given that He may dwell in our bodies and
sanctify them, that in so doing He may bring
them to eternity and to the resurrection of
immortality, while He accustoms them in
Himself to be conjoined with heavenly powers
and to be associated with the Divine eternity
of the Spirit.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></span></p>

<p>A second remark is this. Whatever is
allowed for the moulding force of environment,
Christ plainly teaches that man is never the
mere creature of circumstances. Christ is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
fatalist philosopher. It is only the evil that
man deliberately assimilates which defiles him.
‘There is nothing from without a man that
entering into him can defile him’&mdash;a parabolic
saying which has a deep meaning. As it
is with sin, so it is with disease. Wilful sin is
lawlessness in the spiritual being; disease
is disorder in the material being. Much
remains yet to be done, which lies well within
the range of the free human will, to combat
this lawless disorder in the life of body and
soul. We believe that the spirit can impose
its own order and law and harmony upon the
material elements of our bodily frame. This
creed may be an ideal, but it is the only really
inspiring ideal; for beyond it lies the hope
of final perfection. Therefore, with faith and
courage, let us press forward.</p>

HEALING</h2>
</div>

<div class="auth2"><span class="smcap">By Ellis Roberts</span></div>


<p>The object of this paper is to show and
comment on the present attitude of the
Church of England, and of the Churches
in communion with her, towards psychic
healing: but it may be advisable to remove
at the outset one or two misconceptions.
With the theory and practice of the Church
in this country before the Reformation I am
not now concerned. It did not differ essentially
from that of the Churches on the Continent.
But it should be noticed that a large number
of centres for psychic healing, spiritual
hospitals, if one may use the term, were
removed by the destruction of shrines. In
the medieval Church the healer, with his
specific charisma, was generally one who
was reputed a saint; and usually he healed
more people after his death than before.
The curious in this matter may consult the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
evidence gathered in Dr. Abbott’s ‘St. Thomas
of Canterbury,’ and I think an unprejudiced
reader will gather from that book conclusions
somewhat different from those expected by
the author.</p>

<p>After the Reformation what signs are
there of psychic healing encouraged and
sanctioned by the Church? We are compelled
to answer that, in spite of great need,
there is very little evidence of an intelligent
effort at mental therapeutics. ‘In spite
of great need,’ I say; for this country and
Scotland were affected most terribly by the
disgraceful witch mania which raged over
Europe, especially in the Protestant countries.
There was ample material for the quiet,
consoling influence of psychic healing; but
alas! the unfortunate ‘witches’ were left
to the mercy of scared judges and malicious
finders, to the horrors of the trial by floating,
or the ordeal of the secret mark. The Church
was, apparently, bigoted and powerless.</p>

<p>Yet the existence of an official power,
inherent in the Body and acting normally
through the Ministers of the Church, was
recognised officially in the Canons of 1603–4,
which, of course, are still of authority. In
the 72nd Canon we read:</p>

<p>‘No Minister or Ministers shall, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
the Licence and direction of the Bishop of the
diocese first obtained and had under his hand
and seal, appoint or keep any solemn Fasts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Neither shall any Minister&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. presume
to appoint or hold any meetings for sermons&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
nor, without such licence, to attempt
upon any pretence whatsoever either of possession
or obsession, by fasting and prayer, to
cast out any Devil or Devils, under pain of
the imputation of imposture or cosenage, and
deposition from the ministry.’</p>

<p>It is evident from this that, however
little it was used, the Episcopate was regarded
as possessing the power to licence exorcisers
who might deal with diseases that we should
call mental.</p>

<p>There is one other piece of evidence&mdash;practical
this time&mdash;that the healing power
of the Church was not entirely forgotten or
neglected. Up to the time of the Hanoverian
dynasty, the Kings of England touched for
scrofula, popularly known, from this method
of cure, as ‘The King’s evil.’ The most
celebrated patient I can call to mind is Dr.
Johnson. It may be objected that this
practice was not the work of the Church’s
ministry; but it must be remembered that
most Canonists regard the King of England
as <i>mixta persona</i> (that is, semi-clerical) by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
virtue of his Coronation; and also the position
given the Sovereign as ‘Supreme Governor’
of the Church would appear to invest him
with an ecclesiastical status<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></span></p>

<p>I admit, however, as must all candid
persons, that on the whole the Church has
grossly neglected all forms of psychic healing;
and so welcome the more gladly the definite
stand taken in the Lambeth Report, 1908.</p>

<p>That Report is the unanimous act, not
merely of the Church of England, but of those
numerous bodies in communion with her: on
the committee which drew up the report
were bishops from America, India, Scotland,
Central Africa, New Zealand, and England&mdash;a
fact that can vouch for the significance of
the Report’s admissions and contentions. This
Report I shall take as the basis of my inquiry
into the official attitude of the Church of
to-day towards Medicine and Psychic Healing.</p>

<p>The Report opens with a statement that is
refreshing in its admission of ignorance after
the ready words of many sciolists and ‘quack’
healers.</p>

<p>‘Your Committee, which has had under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
consideration “Ministries of Healing,” has
felt itself at a disadvantage in discussing
phenomena which only in recent times have
been the subject of scientific investigation.
In the present stage of knowledge it would
be premature for any except experts to
hazard an opinion upon such topics as the
powers of “Mental Suggestion,” and the
range of “Subliminal Consciousness,” or to
attempt to forecast the possibilities of
“Mental” or “Spiritual Healing.”&#8202;’</p>

<p>While, however, displaying this diffidence
in dealing with the scientific side of their subject,
the Committee is quite definite about the
spiritual aspect of pain, sickness, and suffering.</p>

<p>‘The Committee believes that Christ still
fulfils in Christian experience His power to
give life, and to give it more abundantly;
and that the faith, which realises His Presence,
is capable of creating a heightened vitality
of spirit, which strengthens and sustains the
health of the body. The Committee believes
that sickness and disease are in one aspect a
breach in the harmony of the Divine purpose,
not only analogous to, but sometimes at least
caused by, want of moral harmony with the
Divine Will; and that this restoration of
harmony in mind and will often brings with
it the restoration of the harmony of the body.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
It believes that sickness has too often exclusively
been regarded as a cross to be borne
with passive resignation, whereas it should
have been regarded rather as a weakness to
be overcome by the power of the Spirit.’</p>

<p>Then the Committee considers briefly the
‘Mental Healing’ movement outside the
Church, and concludes the first part of their
Report with a very necessary warning ‘against
the peril of being thoughtlessly drawn into
alliance, in the desire for health, with any
who, under whatever attractive name, are
in antagonism with the Christian faith upon
any such subject as the Incarnation, the
Resurrection, the reality of Sin, and the
use of the Holy Sacraments.’</p>

<p>In the second part it discusses ‘Spiritual
Healing’ in the Church, and makes the following
statement:</p>

<p>‘The Committee would not wish to say a
word in disparagement or discouragement of
those who may be pioneers in a new branch
of service, but it believes it would for the
present be unwise to depart from an attitude
of watchfulness and reserve; and it is not
therefore prepared to recommend that at the
present stage any authoritative recognition
should be given to those who claim to exercise
these “Gifts of Healing.”&#8202;’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span></p>

<p>In the third part is a most welcome
recognition of the position in the Church of
that profession which the Evangelist of the
Nativity followed.</p>

<p>‘The Committee believes that medical
science is the handmaid of God and His Church,
and should be fully recognised as the ordinary
means appointed by Almighty God for the
care and healing of the human body. The Committee
believes that discoveries in the region
of medicine and surgery come to man through
Him who is the Light and the Life, the Divine
Word.’</p>

<p>Then we have a brief recommendation that
there should be an ‘addition to the office
for the Visitation of the Sick of more hopeful
and less ambiguous petitions for the restoration
of health, always subject to the Will of God&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;;
and that these petitions be used in
close connection with prayer for pardon and
peace.’ And these prayers ‘may be fitly
accompanied by the Apostolic act of the Laying
on of Hands.’</p>

<p>In the final paragraph the Committee
considers the suggestion ‘that these prayers
should be accompanied by the anointing of
the sufferer with oil,’ and after a brief historical
<i>résumé</i>, concludes:</p>

<p>‘In view of this evidence and the conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
prevailing in the Church at the present time,
the Committee is not prepared to recommend
the restoration of the unction of the sick,
but it does not wish to go so far as to advise
the prohibition of its use, if it be earnestly
desired by the sick person. In all such cases
the parish priest should seek the counsel of
the Bishop of the diocese. Care must be
taken that no return be made to the later
custom of anointing as a preparation for
death.’</p>

<p>With unction I do not propose to deal here.
The question is really theological; and the
discussion as to its revival does not come
within the scope of this book. It may be
said, however, that the problem will probably
solve itself in the near future, as in many
missionary and colonial dioceses, and in not
a few English ones, the oil is blessed by the
Bishop, and may always be had by any parish
priest whose sick people desire this ancient
rite.</p>

<p>With one exception, to which I shall return
later, the Report may be commended as a
courageous, if rather jejune, effort to keep
abreast of modern psychology and its more
practical manifestations. Let me indicate
briefly the encouraging signs in the Report.</p>

<p>(1) We have the definite confession that our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
present visitation service is not all that can
be desired. That we should use more definite
prayers for the recovery of the sick.</p>

<p>(2) The Report lays emphasis on the important
truth that there must be no banishing
of the doctor. Enormous harm has been
done by the crude dualism of ‘Christian
Science’&mdash;a theory which, if logically applied,
would prevent persons renewing the tissues
of their body by food, or removing dirt by
soap and water. A doctor’s medicine is just
as much a prayer, a spiritual thing, when it is
properly used, as any formula of consolation
inculcated by folk in ‘tune with the infinite,’
or people who indulge in ‘higher thought.’</p>

<p>(3) The Report guards&mdash;though perhaps not
quite strongly enough&mdash;against the modern
tendency to lay too much stress on mere bodily
health. As Christians and men of sense, we
can have nothing to do with a mode of thought
that, by exaggerating the value of physical
well-being, would cheerfully have condemned to
some lethal chamber an Erasmus, a Coleridge,
a Stevenson, or a Beardsley.</p>

<p>Now in these three matters the Report
does seem to represent the real central body
of opinion in the Church of England. No
living man, perhaps, better expresses the
view of the ‘man in the pew’ than the Bishop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
of London, and he has been one of the first
to recognise the reality of the need for a
greater recognition of the place of psychic
healing. Here is what Dr. Ingram said in
his sermon on St. Luke’s Day, 1909:</p>

<p>‘We have on the one side those who really
seem to have forgotten the message of the
Gospel of the body, who practically in their
teaching and even in their own belief simply
think of the Gospel as addressed to the soul.
They seem to have forgotten that, in our
own Holy Communion Service, we pray that
our sinful bodies may be made clean by His
Body, and some of St. Paul’s most stirring
passages are about the body. “Glorify God
in your body.” But in their teaching and
in their belief they have lost to a certain
extent the idea that the Gospel has a message
to the body at all. While on the other hand&mdash;and
it is so very characteristic of the history
of the Church that this should happen&mdash;outside
the Church, with great exaggeration&mdash;and
with, in my opinion, much false teaching&mdash;people
are calling the attention of the
Church to a forgotten truth. Yes&mdash;but with two
very grave mistakes. First, they ignore the
learning and teaching which God has given
us through medical study and investigation
about His laws and about His will, and still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
more they ignore those blessed means of
grace which Christ Himself has laid down
as the means of our communion with His
life.’</p>

<p>Or again, in a diocesan letter of May last
year the Bishop of Winchester (who was
Chairman of the Lambeth Committee) emphasises
the right of medical science, of
healing, and of nursing, to their due place in
the Church’s spiritual life, to a part in her
prayers and thanksgivings.</p>

<p>‘At the recent Lambeth Conference the
view was expressed that we as a Church have
failed to show sufficient sympathy with the
great works of healing, of conflict with disease,
and of the alleviation of suffering carried on
by the medical and nursing profession. The
Divine blessing vouchsafed in modern times,
through the progress of knowledge and the
advancement of skill, have only in too small
a degree been allowed to enter into the prayers
and thanksgivings of the Christian Church.
It is right that, with greater faith and a larger
intelligence, the Church of Christ should acknowledge
that the gifts of healing and the
discoveries of science come from the Spirit
of God, and should seek more systematically
to include this and kindred subjects in intercession
and praise.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

<p>Not only, however, do we find the Bishops
laying stress on the Church’s duty in the
matter of healing; but we also find eminent
physicians, who are also Churchmen, welcoming
the priest in the sick room. In a remarkable
article contributed to the <i>Guardian</i>,
Sir Dyce Duckworth wrote:</p>

<p>‘Next, I will express my opinion that our
twentieth-century Christendom is generally
lax and feeble in offering earnest prayers for
the sick in all stages and for a blessing on
the remedial means employed. We should
look to a higher Power than that of man to
aid us at the bedside, and as thoughtful
physicians we do seek these means to aid us.</p>

<p>‘Mental healing has a recognised and long-acknowledged
basis of truth and fact, and may
be employed by honourable and skilled doctors
who have the gift and power to use it. I do not
regard it as a fitting duty for the “priests of the
soul,” but one to be employed in its appropriate
place, as it becomes better understood in the
course of time as a part of legitimate ordinary
treatment. I see no objection to the practice
of unction and laying-on of hands by Christian
ministers for those who desire it, but I regard
this as an additional means of help, a solemn
form of assurance and comfort, together with
prayerful ministration, in conjunction with,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
and as a reinforcement of, the best skill of
legitimate medicine. To replace the latter by
the former I regard as a withholding of God’s
gifts to man and therefore unjustifiable. I
conceive and believe that the gifts of the Holy
Spirit are capable of development in the course
of the ages and under our present dispensation,
and that they were not limited in form and
exclusiveness to the age in which they were first
somewhat crudely manifested.’</p>

<p>We may welcome particularly Sir Dyce
Duckworth’s emphatic pronouncement about
prayer. After all the basis of psychic healing
is, and always has been, prayer&mdash;whether
the means used is oil, or water, or the relics
or even the shadow of holy men, as reported
in the Acts of the Apostles. The motive
power that makes any of these means availing
is simply prayer. Prayer, whether spoken,
desired, or acted, is the vital force that gives
the psychic movement all its validity. In
insisting on the importance and reality of
prayer we have the support of such a psychologist
as Professor James, who writes: ‘As
regards prayers for the sick, if any medical
fact can be considered to stand firm, it is
that in certain environments prayer may
contribute to recovery and should be encouraged
as a therapeutic measure.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<p>And if the doctor is willing to recognise
the great value of prayer, the divine should
not be backward in welcoming the doctor;
nor should he regard the medical man and
the philosopher with suspicion if they lay
stress chiefly on the ‘reflex’ value of prayer;
regard its subjective effects, rather than investigate
its real or objective power.</p>

<p>Once more let me quote the Bishop of London:</p>

<p>‘If I was ill, I would send for the best
doctor, and get my parish priest to come and
pray by my side, believing that the double
work of Jesus Christ is shared by two great
professions. It would be bad for either to be
banished from the sick room.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></span></p>

<p>That is the position on which we should
lay stress. The future, I am sure, lies with
those who are willing to accept the religion of
the Incarnation and all that it signifies; the
men who proclaim joyfully and unwaveringly
that Spirit has dwelt in flesh, but who also
never hesitate to assert that it is real Flesh in
which the Spirit dwelt. We must have no
quarter with the damnable heresy that denies
to sin and suffering and disease a reality that
it concedes to food and to fees: and we can
have no truce with the hard materialism that
will acknowledge the truth of nothing that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
not revealed to the scalpel or the test-tube.
We may be thankful to-day that so many of
our leading physicians are becoming more
and more willing to admit the reality of prayer
and the rights of the priest; we must take care
that no headstrong divines, in their new zeal
for psychic healing, disparage or despise the
profession of St. Luke.</p>

WELL-BEING</h2>
</div>

<div class="auth2"><span class="smcap">By Arthur W. Robinson</span>, D.D.</div>


<p>The editor of this volume thinks that it should
include a paper upon the relation of the
Eucharist to bodily well-being, and he has asked
me to deal with the question. I am fully
aware of the difficulty of doing so, and shall
be well content if what I am able to say should
lead others to feel, as I do, that the subject is
one which deserves much reverent and careful
attention. Perhaps that is all that any of us
who are taking part in the production of this
book can hope to achieve. Our desire is to be
allowed to prepare the way for the clearer and
stronger action of the future. Little by little
we are coming to see that the scope of Christianity
is bigger and more comprehensive than
has for some time been supposed. We can
trace the steps by which religion and its
benefits had got to be looked upon as chiefly,
if not exclusively, concerned with individuals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
and their souls. And we can recognise that
there have been, and are, counter-movements
at work whose tendency is to raise us out of
the limitations within which we had settled
and to place our feet in a larger room.</p>

<p>To begin with, there has been the revival
of the Corporate aspect of the faith, with an
insistence upon the truth that the fullest life
is only to be realised through fellowship.
Very slowly we have been learning that we
are not meant to be perfected as individuals,
but as parts of a whole of which Christ is the
head and we are all of us members. Already
this sense of a corporate ideal has made a great
difference to our thoughts about the Church
and the Sacraments, and has begun to work
a change in our beliefs as to the importance of
unity and the possibilities of spiritual power.
And now it looks as if we are being called to
a yet farther enlargement of our conceptions
and hopes. To-day we are bidden to add to
our knowledge in another direction. This
time it is the Corporal aspect of the Christian
message which is coming into view. We are
to learn that our religion is not only for us all
as a whole, but that it has to do with the whole
of each of us. In other words it is good for the
body as well as for the soul. In some degree,
no doubt, we have been accustomed to admit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
that the fact of the Incarnation is a witness to
the dignity of our bodies, and a pledge of their
ultimate glorification; but the admission has
too often lacked the full force of a living
conviction. At the present moment, however,
many influences are combining in a remarkable
way to send us ‘back to Christ’ with quite a
new willingness to believe that He meant His
Church to stand in the forefront of all endeavours
to bless men’s bodies as well as to save
their souls. Some day the world may be
filled with astonishment when it sees the fuller
life of Christian fellowship brought to bear
upon the social and physical problems that
are waiting all around us for the power that
can successfully deal with them.</p>

<p>Now, plainly such lines of thought must
sooner or later converge upon the Eucharist.
We may confidently assert that if the fuller
life, corporate or corporal, is to be realised and
manifested by us, it will be through a more
faithful and more intelligent use of the great
means which our Lord has provided for
establishing a vital inter-communion between
Himself and His members.</p>

<p>Let us, then, approach the consideration
of the mystery patiently, and make a serious
effort to grasp what we can of its meaning
in right perspective and due proportion. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
this end it will be best to set before our minds
a clear statement of the aims and objects of the
highest of all Christian services.</p>

<p class="mt15em">Briefly, we may say that the Eucharist is
designed to fulfil a threefold purpose for us.
In the first place, it is a <span class="lowercase smcap">SIGN OF PROFESSION</span>.
Sacraments are ‘not only badges or tokens
of Christian men’s profession’ (Art. xxv.); but
this they most certainly are. Again and again
our Lord laid stress upon the duty and
necessity of an open acknowledgment of
discipleship. From the earliest times the
Sacrament of His Body and Blood has been
regarded as the oath and pledge of a Christian’s
loyalty. We may be sure that Christ meant
it to be this. Perhaps it is not altogether
without significance that while the ancient
allegory of the Old Testament had made the
test of obedience, ‘Thou shalt not eat’; in
the sacred symbolism of the New Covenant
it became, ‘Do this,’ ‘Take eat.’ Through
the Eucharist we declare our readiness to be
known as members of the Christian fellowship,
and our determination to be the true followers
of Christ. That is its first and simplest and
most obvious signification.</p>

<p>Then further the Eucharist is <span class="lowercase smcap">AN ACT OF
WORSHIP</span>. It has a Godward aspect, as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
as a bearing towards the Church and the world.
The original institution had for its background
the slaying of the lambs and the pouring out
of the blood of the Passover sacrifices. This,
said our Lord, is My way of celebrating the
redemption, not merely of a nation, but of a
world. ‘This is My Blood of the Covenant,
which is shed for many.’ And accordingly
whenever we solemnly repeat His words and
His acts, we do it in a Consecration Prayer
addressed not to man but to God. It has been
thus that from the beginning the Church has
made the ‘perpetual memory,’ setting forth the
finished sacrifice of the Cross as the one and only
ground and hope of man’s salvation. It is thus
that we draw nigh by the ‘new and living way
which He has prepared for us’ until we find
ourselves amid all the company of heaven, nay
more, suppliants before the very throne of
God, humbly but confidently asking for the
grace to help us in our earthly need. The
prayer is freely granted. The very offerings
we present are blessed and returned for our
enrichment.</p>

<p>And so, finally, the Eucharist is a <span class="lowercase smcap">MEANS
OF GRACE</span>. The Altar becomes a Table, and
the Sacrifice ends in a Feast. We are bidden,
not only to ‘do this,’ but to ‘eat’ and ‘drink’
the Body and Blood. Here it is that we reach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
the most mysterious aspect of all. Christ
died and rose again for us that we might live
by Him. In this holiest fellowship He fulfils
His promise to be with us; in this highest
worship we are made partakers of His very self.
How the blessing is bestowed we are unable
to explain. The explanations that have been
attempted are not really explanations, for
they are not themselves intelligible. But we
can do better than explain. We can accept
the fact, and look to prove it in experience.
That is the way of our English Church teaching.
‘The benefit is great,’ we are assured, ‘if
with a true penitent heart and lively faith we
receive this Holy Sacrament, for then we
spiritually eat the Flesh of Christ and drink
His Blood.’ ‘The Body and Blood of Christ
are verily and indeed’&mdash;not merely metaphorically
and symbolically&mdash;‘taken and
received by the faithful.’ So it has been
believed since the foundation of the Church.
‘The doctrine of the reality of the gift bestowed
in the Holy Communion is universal in the
writings of the early Christians.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></span> And so it
will be to the end, when the holy feast is to be
royally ‘fulfilled in the kingdom of God.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span></p>

<p>It is in connexion with this third aspect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
of the Eucharist that we are to attempt some
further inquiry. Granted that ‘the benefit is
great,’ of what does it consist? When we
meet together in the gladness of loyal fellowship
to ‘lift up our hearts’ through the
worship which unites us to the Great High
Priest within the veil; when we receive, as
from His hands, the more than tokens of our
participation in His present life and coming
triumph; when after meekly kneeling for the
benediction of the heavenly peace, we rise and
go our way&mdash;what thoughts may we dare to
cherish with regard to the blessing that has
been granted to us?</p>

<p>Shall we answer that the gain must be
of a spiritual character, that what we have
received is ‘the strengthening and refreshing
of our souls,’ that this is what is intended when
the Eucharist is spoken of as a ‘means of
grace’? Assuredly we shall be right to
answer thus. We cannot insist upon it too
strongly, or claim it too confidently. We may
not feel at the moment that we are stronger
and more able for our life and duty; but then
we do not always feel the benefit of physical
food and medicine the moment they have been
taken. The gain may not appear for hours
or even days, when perhaps we have ceased
to think of the source from which it came.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
Strangely enough, too, the immediate effect
of a medicine may be to bring out the mischief,
and to make us imagine that we are the worse
for it rather than the better; and, as we know,
there have been times when it has almost
seemed as if we had become more distressingly
conscious of our faults and failings as a result
of our Communion. In spite of it all, faith
takes and gives humble thanks for the blessing
which has been received.</p>

<p>But, when we say that the blessing is of
a spiritual nature, does that mean that its
effects are therefore limited to the spiritual
sphere? Can we think that they could be
so limited? Is not the spiritual the dominant
factor in all our life, and must not the quickening
and gladdening of our spirits be felt, sooner
or later, through every department of our
being?</p>

<p>Is it not true that the mind is profoundly
influenced by the state of the spirit; that,
when the soul is at peace and in harmony
with God’s will, light shines as it were from
within upon the hardest and most perplexing
problems around us? The good and wise
Bishop Harold Browne once declared at a
Church Congress that he had never known
what it was to have intellectual doubts when
present at the Holy Communion. So, too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
one of the most brilliant of our living teachers,
speaking of what he owed to the school chapel
at Eton, has said, ‘There I mercifully gained
the habit of constant Communion; and this
habit was the one permanent stronghold of
my faith when in after years at Oxford the
violent storms of intellectual trouble broke
over my mind.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></span></p>

<p>If the mind may be helped through blessing
received by the spirit, why not the body also?
We are realising more and more forcibly every
year how intimate is the connexion between
mental action and the physical organism.
The two are so linked that every change in the
one would seem to be accompanied by a change
in the other. Moreover, we are assured by
recent psychology that there are regions within
us which lie outside&mdash;above and below&mdash;the
levels of our ordinary consciousness; and that
influences exerted in these regions are determining
causes, not merely of mental, but of bodily
states. The close connexion between the
spiritual and the physical is clearly insisted
upon in the New Testament teaching. Our
Lord showed plainly that the problem of
bodily disease was not to be treated apart from
the more baffling needs of the soul. In
unhesitating terms He traced the miseries of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
morbid physical conditions to moral wrongdoing
and the presence of spiritual forces of
evil. The great word ‘Salvation’ strictly
interpreted meant health; and it was applied
to both body and soul. It is no small part of
Christ’s redemption to ‘quicken your mortal
bodies through His Spirit that dwelleth in
you.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span></p>

<p>The fact that the body has its appointed
part and share in the Holy Communion is
in itself significant of the honour to be paid
to it, and might be taken to imply that it too
is to be partaker of the benefit. And when
St. Paul declares that to receive ‘unworthily’
is to be in danger of bodily sickness and even
of death<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span> we can scarcely avoid the inference
that for the worthy recipient there might be
expected some corresponding advantage of
quickened health and physical vitality.</p>

<p class="mt15em">If we ask what the thoughts of early
Christianity were in regard to this matter, we
need remain in no uncertainty as to the reply.
Recent discovery of documents and the critical
study of the primitive liturgies have given us
a great deal of knowledge as to the religious
conceptions of those who met for Christian
worship in the centuries after the Apostles.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
At first it was with reluctance that they
committed their most sacred formularies to
writing. Even as late as the time of Athanasius
the precise nature of the liturgy was
kept as a secret, to be revealed only to those
who would be certain to regard it with reverence
and understanding. ‘It is not permitted,’
he wrote, ‘to describe the mysteries to those
who are not initiated.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></span> Not until this discipline
of secrecy was gradually abandoned, as
Christianity came to be accepted throughout
the empire, were the actual forms of service
allowed to become public property. From
these we are able to gather much as to the
place which the Eucharist held in the life of
the Church, and as to the hopes that were
centred in it. These hopes, without question,
were primarily of a spiritual sort. Intercession
was offered with a fulness and intensity which
witness to a wonderful power of sustained
devotion and a boundless range of sympathy.
There were many and various prayers for the
peace and perfecting of the Church and the
enlightenment of the world, for the spread of
true knowledge, for the sanctification of all
estates of believers, and above all, and most
of all, for the exaltation and glory of God in
earth as in heaven. But no one can so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
as glance over these liturgies without being
strongly impressed by the fact that those who
framed them and used them had no notion
of drawing any sharp line of distinction
between the spiritual and the material, between
the blessing of the soul and the good to be
desired for the body. If they made intercession
for the Church that it might be ‘kept
sheltered from storms’ and be ‘preserved
founded upon the rock until the consummation
of the world,’ and were careful to remember
the higher needs of all classes of Christian
people, they were quick to add, ‘Let us pray
for our brethren exercised by sickness, that
the Lord may deliver them from every disease
and from every infirmity, and may restore
them whole to His Holy Church.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></span> In the
prayer of Consecration they would ask that
the Bread and the Wine might be made to all
who received them a means of ‘faith, and
watchfulness, and healing, and sober-mindedness,
and sanctification, and renovation of
soul and body and spirit.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></span> When they had
partaken of the elements they implored that
these might ‘not be unto condemnation but to
salvation, for the benefit of soul and body.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></span></p>

<p>Just ten years ago a very important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
addition was made to our store of early
liturgical documents by the publication of the
Sacramentary of Bishop Serapion, which dates
from 350 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.D.</span> The work consists of thirty
prayers such as a bishop would be likely
to use<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></span> Of these the first six and the last
twelve have to do with the celebration of the
Eucharist; the remainder relate to Baptism,
Confirmation, Ordination, and Burial.</p>

<p>‘Life is a remarkable note of the collection,’
and it is life in the fullest sense of the word.
A few quotations will indicate this, and will
serve to strengthen the impression we have
already sought to convey as to the content of
the blessing to be expected in the Eucharist.
In the opening Offertory prayer we find the
words, ‘We beseech Thee, make us living
men.’ At the invocation of the Word upon
the elements, ‘Make all who communicate
to receive a medicine of life for the healing
of any sickness.’ In ‘the prayer for those
who have suffered,’ ‘Grant health and soundness,
and cheerfulness and all advancement
of soul and body.’ And in the final Benediction,
‘Let the communion of the Body and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
Blood go with this people. Let their bodies
be living bodies, and their souls be clean
souls.’ Provision is also made for special
prayer for the sick, and for the blessings of oils
and waters for their benefit, and in these
connexions we find such expressions as the
following: ‘Be propitious, Master; assist and
heal all that are sick. Rebuke the sicknesses.’
‘Grant them to be counted worthy of health.’
‘Make them to have perfect health of body
and soul.’ ‘Grant healing power upon these
creatures that every power and every evil
spirit and every sickness may depart.’</p>

<p>It need scarcely be said that all such
references to bodily wants are set in a context
which is marked by the simplest and most
ardent spiritual devotion. The physical is
never allowed to usurp the first place. But
it is never forgotten. The early Christians
believed that the Life which was offered to
them in fellowship with their Lord was to
extend to every part of their constitution,
to ‘spirit and soul and body.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span></p>
<p>In the light of our increasing knowledge of
psychological processes, we to-day are turning
with new interest and sympathy to the old
stories of marvellous healing that have come
down to us from early and medieval times;
and we are doing our best, by careful investigation
and analysis, to separate the well-authenticated
cases from those for which the evidence
is not satisfactory. Already it is clear beyond
reasonable doubt that the instances in which
directly religious influences wrought extraordinary
cures were far more numerous than
have been generally admitted by critical
students of the history. In Mr. Percy Dearmer’s
volume entitled ‘Body and Soul’ a
large number of testimonies have been collected
relating to such experiences at various
times throughout the Christian centuries. Thus
the passage from St. Augustine is quoted, in
which he said that in his days miracles were
still being wrought, ‘partly by the sacraments,’
and partly through other instrumentalities.
And instances of such miracles are described
as they were recorded of Bernard, and
Francis, and Catherine of Siena; of Philip
Neri, Fox, Wesley, Cardinal Hohenlohe,
Pastor Blumhardt, Father John of Cronstadt,
and many more. At least two cases are
given in which the benefit was definitely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
connected with the reception of Holy Communion<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></span></p>

<p class="mt15em">It remains now to ask how far we English
Church people have any guidance to which
we can appeal in our liturgical forms. We
have to admit that the well-being of the body
does not receive the amount of consideration
in our Prayer-book that it did receive in more
primitive days. And yet the allusions are
more frequent than many imagine. At the
outset of Morning and Evening Prayer we
are reminded that we have met ‘to ask those
things which are requisite and necessary as
well for the body as the soul.’ Over and over
we repeat the clause in the Lord’s Prayer&mdash;‘Give
us this day our daily bread.’ In the
Creed we joyfully attest our belief in the
‘resurrection of the body.’ In the Litany we
pray to be delivered from ‘plague and pestilence.’
A special intercession is appointed
for use ‘in the time of common plague or
sickness,’ as well as the more general one for all
who are ‘any ways afflicted, or distressed, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
mind, body, or estate,’ with a particular
remembrance of ‘those for whom our prayers
are desired.’ In the Collects, which were
intended primarily for use at the Eucharist, we
find petitions for help in ‘our infirmities,’ for
defence from ‘all adversities which may happen
to the body,’ for preservation ‘both in body and
soul,’ and for readiness of ‘body’ to do the
Divine will. In the Office for Holy Communion
we may be glad to note even clearer
traces of the Scriptural and primitive conception
as to the place which the physical
part of our nature is entitled to hold in the
religion of the Incarnation.</p>

<p>When we say the prayer for the whole
Church, we humbly beseech God ‘to comfort
and succour all those who in this transitory
life are in trouble, sorrow, need, sickness,
or any other adversity.’ In the Prayer of
Humble Access there are petitions, first to be
met with in the earliest form of the English
service (1548), which sound like an echo
from the already quoted Prayer-book of
Serapion, ‘that our sinful bodies may be
made clean by His Body, and our souls washed
through His most precious Blood.’ Even
more intentionally significant are the words of
administration appointed to be addressed to
every communicant, ‘The Body of our Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
Jesus Christ preserve thy body and soul unto
everlasting life’; ‘The Blood of our Lord
Jesus Christ preserve thy body and soul
unto everlasting life.’ These references to the
‘body’ appear to have been deliberately
introduced into our service. In the Latin
form the celebrant had said, ‘custodiat animam
meam in vitam aeternam.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></span> And as the body
has its place of privilege, so also it has a share
of the corresponding responsibility. In the
Prayer of Oblation ‘we offer and present our
souls and bodies to be a reasonable, holy, and
lively sacrifice.’ Finally, among the Collects
suggested to be said after the Offertory, and
at other times ‘as occasion shall serve,’ the
foremost place is given to two which are
closely connected with the thought of bodily
welfare. The first, ‘Assist us mercifully, O
Lord,’ was a prayer used in medieval times
for persons who had gone on a pilgrimage to
seek physical as well as spiritual blessings;
the second is for the sanctification and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
governance of ‘both our hearts and bodies,’
that we may be ‘preserved in body and
soul, through our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ.’</p>

<p>So then, in our Prayer-book, as in the
older service books, the benefit of the body
is closely associated with the gain which is
sought for the soul. The physical effect is
regarded as dependent upon the spiritual
gift. As the Bishop of Birmingham has put it,
‘though in the Holy Communion the body
is sanctified through the sanctification of our
spirit, and transformed and endowed, in subtle
and secret ways which pass our comprehension,
with capacity for the life immortal; yet it
is through the spirit and not directly.<span class="nowrap">’<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></span> The
blessing begins with the spirit, but it certainly
does not end there.</p>

<p class="mt15em">This sketch of a great subject, imperfect
as it has been, may serve to turn the thoughts
of some of us to an aspect of our religious
privileges which has not been very much
before our minds. A friend who had been
spending a good deal of time on ‘cures’ on
the continent as well as in this country, wrote
to me lately to say that he was beginning to
think that he ought to get more assistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
towards recovery from his religion than he had
been getting. That is an idea which accords
with the temper of the first Christians, and is
certainly encouraged by a careful study of our
own Prayer-book. We dare not assert that all
‘the ills that flesh is heir to’ would disappear
before a quickened vitality of soul, and the
mental soundness which might follow from
this; but we can well believe that the tendency
of true religion is all in the direction of physical
health. Indeed, we may go so far as to say
that there is no restorative force that we know
of to compare with the influence of spiritual
peace and gladness. We have amongst us
those who are fully conscious that they have
owed much bodily strength to prayers and to
sacraments. And there are medical men who
would not hesitate to give their confirmatory
testimony from what they have seen in their
experiences of the sick.</p>

<p>Sometimes we hear of small attendance
at the weekly or daily Eucharist. If this
is to be remedied it will be because truer
views have come to prevail again of the meaning
of the greatest service of the Church. We
shall recover the spiritual fervour and force
of primitive Christianity when we learn once
more to give the Eucharist its proper place
in our worship and our life. We might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
helped to do this if, like the first Christians,
we accustomed ourselves to look to our
Communions not only for the blessing that
they can bring to our souls, but for the lesser,
and yet not less real, blessing which we may
find in them for the sanctification and preservation
of our bodies.</p>

</div>

<div class="auth2"><span class="smcap">By the Bishop of Bloemfontein</span></div>


<p>This paper is concerned with Mental Healing;
its object is to suggest, in a tentative way,
how Mental Healing may be effected by Mental
Prayer. But, in order to do this, it is necessary
(at the risk of repeating what may have been
written by others) to refer to certain premises
leading up to the conclusion which I wish to
draw.</p>

<p>(1) In the first place it is coming to be
recognised that ‘consciousness’ must be understood
in a far wider and more general sense
than we have been accustomed to associate
with it. Alongside of the active work of the
intellect with which, e.g., we study mathematics
or pursue our profession, there is a
large, dreamy, half-conscious tract of mind,
not sharpened to a single point, like the active
intellect, but consisting in a multiplicity of
mind-centres (mental ganglia, as we might
call them) diffused throughout the body. We
knew before that our body was a microcosm
or an epitome of the world in which it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
found, and now we are learning that the same
is true of our minds. Primitive kinds of
consciousness have been carried up with us in
our ascent from lower grades of being, and
survive, dormant but real, over against the
intellect which is the palmary achievement
of our race. This residual consciousness (the
consciousness which exists outside of the
rational intellect) consists largely of instincts
and capacities which regulate the lives of
other animals, and which were employed by
man in his primitive state, but for which he
has no use in his present-day existence;
modes of receptivity and reaction, which
were natural to him in his dreamy childhood,
but which are discarded by him in the aggressive,
self-assertive, wide-awake condition in
which he now lives. Mr. Myers, in his ‘Human
Personality,’ gives a very attractive and
convincing account of this inheritance from
our ‘lowly ancestors.’ But probably we have
to go deeper still to account for parts of the
consciousness which we thus inherit. The
rooted attachment to home, and the blind
tenacity with which, in the teeth of reason,
men cling to life, exhibit a more primitive
mode of consciousness than that of animal
life. Here we will quote some very suggestive
words of Professor Stewart:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

<p>‘Transcendental feeling I would explain
genetically as an effect produced within consciousness
by the persistence in us of that
primeval condition from which we are sprung,
when life was still as sound asleep as death, and
there was no time yet. That we should fall
for a while, now and then, from our waking,
time-marking life, into the timeless slumber of
this primeval life is easy to understand; for
the principle solely operative in that primeval
life is indeed the fundamental principle of our
nature, being that “vegetative part of the
soul” which made from the first, and still
silently makes, the assumption on which our
rational life of conduct and science rests&mdash;the
assumption that life is worth living.
When to the “vegetative” the “sensitive”
soul is first added, the Imperative (Live thy
Life) is obeyed by creatures which, experiencing
only isolated feelings, and retaining no
traces of them in memory, still live a timeless
life, without sense of past or future, and consequently
without sense of selfhood. Then,
with memory, there comes, in the higher
animals, some dim sense of a self dating back
and prospecting forward. Time begins to be.’</p>

<p>This, then, is our starting point; that
besides the single, supreme, rational activity,
which we call intellect, there exist in us other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
forms of consciousness similar to those which
accompany the growth of the plant or the life
of the animal; and that this residual consciousness,
however much we may discard or disown
it, continues to live and work, and does things
which the proud intellect is unable to do.
On the other hand, we must not forget that
these forms of feeling and instinct, of perception
and reaction, which we regard as our
heritage from lower grades of life, are enormously
modified by their juxtaposition with a
rational intellect. The unity of nature which
comprehends both the intellect and them,
makes itself felt; this lower form of mentality
is still the mentality of a rational being;
and the general position may be described
by saying that there exists a decentralised
consciousness, diffused through the organism,
‘irrational, but capable of sharing in reason,
and of listening to it,’ as Aristotle would say, and
manifesting itself in a power of receiving impressions,
manipulating them, and reacting upon
them, which in our present state of ignorance we
describe by the convenient word ‘abnormal.’</p>

<p>(2) Because the residual consciousness is
thus diffused throughout the body, it can
exercise control over the various parts of the
body, just as the central intellect exercises
control over the body as a whole. As the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
reason can set the body in motion by commands
issued through the brain and travelling down
the motor nerves, so the departmental consciousness
can initiate changes and disturbances
in the various nerve centres with which it is
associated. This, we take it, is what happens
in all cases of mental healing. The phenomenon
is physical as well as psychical; it consists
not merely in the inhibition of the feeling of pain,
but in such a modification of the nerve tissues
as removes the cause of the pain. A real cure
is effected, and it is effected by the action of
the residual consciousness upon that particular
part of the organism.</p>

<p>(3) This decentralised, residual consciousness
can work best when the rational intellect
is quiescent&mdash;when, we may say, the central
office is closed. At such times man ceases
for the time to be an argumentative, striving
creature; the placid, vegetative, ruminative life,
the life of growth and instinct, asserts itself;
submerged modes of consciousness begin to stir
and act, like fairies dancing when the sun has set.</p>

<p>And as sleep is the typically quiescent
state, it will be specially in sleep, natural or
induced, that these lower modes of consciousness
will exhibit their activity.</p>

<p>(4) In order that they may act, a ‘cue’
or suggestion of some sort must be given to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
them. The most marked characteristic of
this residual consciousness is its receptivity. It
executes, but cannot originate. It can retain
in the memory the whole of a long poem
which it has heard, and it can solve a problem
by right adjustment of its elements; but in
each case the facts must be given to it in
order that it may deal with them. In itself
it is dreamy and desultory; if it is to work
efficiently, it must be stimulated and concentrated
by the transmission to it of a clear
and forcible suggestion.</p>

<p>(5) On the other hand, although it must
take its orders from the reason, it is only natural
that one residual consciousness should be more
<i>en rapport</i>, feel more at home, with another
residual consciousness. The reason is like a
parent or schoolmaster, and these consciousnesses
are like children. They receive their
directions from above, but are far more at
home with each other, canvassing their instructions,
and sometimes parodying and
making fun of them, as children do with the
admonitions of their elders. In matter of
fact there is often something freakish and
elfish about this consciousness, it reminds
one of the submerged spirit of Dionysus
reasserting itself in Denys l’Auxerrois as
described by Mr. Pater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

<p>(6) Now, if one residual consciousness can
be brought into a relationship of definite
and serious purpose with another residual
consciousness, the influence thus exerted will
be stronger than any which can be exerted
directly by the reason itself. To revert to our
former illustrations, a monitor whose own
character is receptive of the master’s ideals
can exert on other children an influence greater
than that of the master himself.</p>

<p>(7) The reason of man, then, may be well
able to convey clear instructions to his own
residual consciousness, and send it to associate
with, and work upon, some other residual
consciousness. And if the instructions conveyed,
and the work done, concern the curing
of some ailment, a case of mental healing will
be the result.</p>

<p>Let A be the healer and B the patient; let
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> represent the residual consciousness
of each of them; further, let A<sup>1</sup> be the rational
intellect of A, and B<sup>2</sup> the seat of B’s disease.
In that case the following diagram will illustrate
the process:</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_275" style="max-width: 15.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_275.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

<p>That is, A concentrates his intellect (A<sup>1</sup>) on
transmitting a message to his own submerged
consciousness (<i>a</i>); this submerged consciousness
works upon B’s submerged consciousness
and stimulates it to curative action on the
seat of B’s disease. Further, the best time
for <i>a</i> to thus work upon <i>b</i> will be when A and B
are both asleep. A will have concentrated
the reason on the idea of helping B just before
going to sleep. Mr. Hudson, in his ‘Psychic
Phenomena,’ gives many illustrations of cures
thus effected.</p>

<p>(8) But the capacity of A to exert a strong
and right influence must depend on the
strength of his will and the clearness of his
insight; and if he is a humble man, he will
recognise his own weakness and ignorance.
In proportion, then, to his affection for B,
he wants to bring to bear on B a stronger
force and a higher wisdom than his own. A
few exceptionally strong and wise people may
bring help, of themselves, to their friends in
the manner described in the last section; but
the majority, being conscious of their own
limitations, will turn elsewhere for succour, i.e.
will pray.</p>

<p>(9) In very many cases prayer is a definite
petition to God, that God will Himself act
directly on our friend by bestowing a definite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
blessing on him, e.g. recovery from a specific
ailment. But that is not quite the highest
or the best kind of prayer. God loves to act
through us; Christ sends out his disciples,
that through them He may continue to do His
gracious works. We can combine a humble
reliance on God with the offer of ourselves as
His instruments, if our prayer conforms to
that Prayer of Quiet or Silence of which
mystical writers tell us. Then, instead of
ourselves acting directly on our friend, and
instead of asking God to act directly upon him,
we shall just concentrate our attention upon
God with special intention for our friend.
We shall hope that a Divine response from
God will, during our sleep perhaps, enter our
own subconscious self (which we have, through
the concentration of our attention, made receptive
of such responses) and through us work
upon that of our friend. In such a case the
diagram will be as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_277" style="max-width: 24.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_277.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We may add that this Prayer of Silence not
only renders us receptive of Divine influences,
which may then through us be transmitted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
our friend; also it embodies the true attitude
of humility in relation to God. We know not
what we should pray for as we ought. We are
not to dictate to God what blessing He is to
send. We simply bring our friend’s evil case
before Him in the very act of our own loving
concentration upon Him, and offer ourselves
as the agents for the transmission of that
blessing, whatever it may be, which He in His
wisdom may will to send. By a strong act
of sympathy we identify ourselves with our
friend, and trust God to provide the right
remedy. ‘Have mercy upon <i>me</i>,’ said the
woman in the Gospel, ‘my daughter is grievously
vexed with a devil.’</p>

<p>If we can combine this living sympathy
for our friend with a humble trust in God’s
power and wisdom, and further offer ourselves
as the instrument through which God may act,
we shall be practising the highest and purest
form of intercession within our reach. And
this form of intercession may be offered in a
silent act of Contemplation, in which distracting
thoughts are set aside, the favourable
attitude of receptivity is attained, and a loving
and concentrated appeal is made to the love
of God. It may, perhaps, encourage us to
engage in this highest form of prayer, if we
recognise that it has this intercessory side.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
An objection is sometimes brought against the
practice of Contemplation as described by
spiritual writers, on the ground that it is self-centred
and selfish. There is never much
force in such an objection, since the contemplative
who is concentrating his soul on God is
thereby making himself a ladder down which
Angels of Grace descend on others as well as
himself; he is diffusing an atmosphere of God’s
presence, with the blessings that flow from it.</p>

<p>When, however, Contemplation is practised
with definite intercessory intention, its beneficence
is clearly and unmistakably emphasised.</p>

<p>(10) It is well to dwell a little more on the
quality of humility which should characterise
all such prayers. We have no right to dictate
to God what His answer shall be. We have
no right to assume that it must be His will
to remove all pain and suffering. Any such
assumption leads logically to conclusions which
those who make it might not be prepared to
accept. If pain and suffering are contrary
to God’s will, and God is omnipotent, it follows
that there can be no such thing as pain and
suffering; and as pain and suffering are
located in the body, it will further be concluded
that there is no such thing as a body; and
here at once we have Christian Science in a
nutshell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span></p>

<p>We may try to escape from this conclusion
by distinguishing an absolute and a contingent
will of God, and arguing that pain, as such,
is contrary, but under certain circumstances
is not contrary, to the will of God. But this
really abandons the whole position, since we
do not know whether the case of our friend
is covered by the ‘certain circumstances’
or not, and therefore are unable to dogmatise
as to God’s will in the matter. No one in his
senses imagines that God wills pain for the
sake of pain. Everyone would agree that, if sin
had not come into the world, there would be
no occasion for pain. But then sin has come
into the world; the only condition of man
with which we are acquainted is his fallen
condition; in that fallen condition sin and
suffering are mingled inextricably to a degree
which utterly condemns dictation or dogmatism
on our part. Ignorant people like ourselves
must, then, be humble in our prayers. We
bring our friend’s illness before God; ‘Lord,
he whom Thou lovest is sick’; often God’s
love may be shown in the removal of the
suffering; sometimes in the provision of
grace sufficient to enable the sufferer to rejoice
in his infirmities.</p>

<p>(11) What has been said in this paper is
liable to an easy and obvious criticism. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
will be said that the whole thing consists of
guesses; and further, that these guesses are
incapable of scientific verification. I cheerfully
accept both statements, and am not
particularly affected by either. All increase
of knowledge has been made through guesses,
and in the case of an intricate subject like
that before us, we must be content to go on
guessing for a long time. Further, there may
be verification which would not conform to
the more rigorous methods, but which would
be sufficient for practical purposes. If we
find that such prayer as I have described is
followed by relief, either physical or spiritual,
to him for whom we pray; and if this sequence
occurs again and again under different conditions,
the cumulative weight of such experience
will justify a humble belief that God
is indeed using us as vehicles of His grace and
love.</p>

<p>(12) Finally, I should like to add a few
words as to the general attitude which, it
seems to me, we should adopt with regard
to facts of mental healing. I have assumed
that we are face to face with certain psychical
facts which for the first time are winning
general recognition of their authenticity. That
is, we are witnessing the birth and development
of a special branch of psychology. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
whole inquiry into the phenomena of the
subconscious, or subliminal, or subjective, or
residual consciousness (whatever we choose to
call it) is a psychological inquiry. It is for
the psychologist to investigate the relation in
which such phenomena stand to the normal
working of the mind; and it is for the psychologist
and physiologist together to probe the
method by which subconscious mentality
affects the diseased tissue, and in many cases
effects a cure. The facts are becoming patent
to all; the causes are a subject matter for
science. Where, then, does religion come in?
I answer that whilst the forces at work are
psychical, and the inquiry into their mode of
operation is scientific, they can be best put in
motion by religion.</p>

<p>Some such demarcation of spheres seems
to me to be essential. It would be fatal
to assume that all manifestation of subconscious
activity is supernatural; that all mental
healing is necessarily spiritual healing. The
facts postulate neither a special spiritual gift,
nor a special theory of the universe (such as
that of Christian Science) to account for them.
They are, we repeat, psychical facts, and come
under the domain of psychology.</p>

<p>Further, as I have suggested above,
religion is not the only motive power by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
which they can be roused to action. A
rigorous process of attention and concentration
of the mind, which has been rendered
quiescent by the elimination of other thoughts
and ideas, seems to be the condition under
which the healer acts successfully; and such
a process is not confined to the sphere of
religion.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, we Christians
possess two great qualifications in this matter.
First, in the higher forms of prayer we have
ready to our hand a peculiarly effective method
of concentration and attention; and, secondly,
through the use of this method, we can link
our own action with the action of God,
correcting our ignorance by the wisdom of
God, and supplementing our weakness by the
power of God.</p>

<p class="mt15em"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In this article I have dealt with
healing as exercised on the ills of another, not
on one’s own ills; and the prayer associated
with such healing has therefore been presented
as intercessory prayer. But of course the
troubles which we have in view may be our
own. In such a case the method will be much
the same as that sketched above; relief may be
effected subconsciously through the medium
of prayer. But the procedure is now much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
simpler. Instead of sending out our subconsciousness
(the phraseology is necessarily
materialistic and fearfully inadequate) to work
on that of another, we merely commission it
to work on the seat of our own malady. The
method now becomes one of auto-suggestion,
i.e. the healing suggestion is made by us to ourselves.
We know the power of this process in
the moral sphere; we know how, by fixing our
minds on lofty and ennobling ideas, we can
break the power of temptation, not by a frontal
attack, but by getting round it and above it to
a higher level of life and thought. This, in
fact, is the main purpose and effect of meditation
as ordinarily practised. The scope of
meditations only have to be slightly extended
in order to apply to our physical as well as our
moral troubles. But, although this method of
healing becomes simpler in procedure, because
applied to ourselves, yet for the same success
it demands still greater humility and purity
of intention. If, when we pray for others, it
is hard for us to believe that the prayer may be
really and effectually answered in other ways
than by the removal of the physical suffering,
it is still harder for us to recognise this in our
own case. To meet this difficulty, it will be
well that prayer for our own relief should be
as much as possible silent prayer. We shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
concentrate our attention on God’s love and
power, as revealed in Christ, just spread out
our trouble before Him, and resolve to trust
Him to the uttermost. The suggestion thus
conveyed to our own subconscious life will be
charged with God’s grace; if physical healing
results, the restored health will be transformed
by dedication to God’s service; if the relief
takes the form of strength to endure, it will be
none the less relief, lifting us above the level
of self-pity into tranquil communion with
Christ crucified, and may be none the less an
instrument in God’s hands for the doing of His
blessed will.</p>

SCIENCE</h2>
</div>

<div class="auth2"><span class="smcap">By M. Carta Sturge</span></div>


<p>In attempting to criticise the Metaphysics of
Christian Science, as put forth in the book
which claims to be the authority for its
doctrine, ‘Science and Health, with Key to
the Scriptures,’ one is tempted to quote the
famous chapter on ‘Snakes in Iceland,’ which
runs ‘There are no snakes in Iceland,’ and to
say at the outset that Christian Science has
no Metaphysics. Since, however, it claims
to explain the Universe, and to give a theory
of such metaphysical subjects as Matter and
Spirit, as well as of Unity and Reality, it
may be well to examine its statements on
these abstruse matters to see if they can
justly claim to have value as Metaphysics,
to search the island, as it were, before pronouncing
that there are no snakes in it.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Christian Science owes a
good deal of its attractiveness to its teaching of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
a sort of popular Idealism. It was put forth
at a time when a great wave of Materialism
had overspread the Christian world, not owing
only to discoveries in Natural Science, which
seemed in the first flush of their triumph,
before they had been adjusted with other fields
of thought, to destroy all belief in Spirit,
but owing also to the fact that Religion
had been for so long established and, apparently,
firmly seated upon a secure spiritual
foundation, that it had been loosely taught
as to its fundamental basis. So little had its
relation with physical things been explained
that the spiritual and physical aspects of the
Universe had become, as it were, separated
in thought and shut up respectively in
watertight compartments. The result was
that in the popular mind the two worlds, the
spiritual and the physical, stood in a merely
artificial relation with each other, connected,
as it were, by unmeaning hooks, instead of
standing in an intimate organic relation, so
close that no true statement regarding the one
could possibly stand in collision with the
truth of the other.</p>

<p>In consequence of this merely artificial
relation of the two in the popular mind, at
the first breath of the new scientific announcements
the two worlds in the minds of only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
too many fell apart, and the spiritual world
floated away, if one may say so, to nowhere,
whilst the physical, with all its limitations,
its ruthless laws, its indifference to the individual,
its total disregard of pain, and its insurmountable
barriers, reigned alone. Materialism
had triumphed with its apparently hard-and-fast
solidity; whilst the ideals of Poetry,
the truths hinted at by Art, the revelations of
the prophet, the dreams of the young and the
visions of the old, and our intuitions of unseen
realities which cannot be uttered, were consigned
by many, supposed to be wise, to the
region of illusions, the realm of nothingness, and
Man seemed indeed to be nothing more than
a creature helplessly subject to circumstance,
the sport of every wind, and entirely beyond
the region of hope wherever physical aid failed.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of a state of things
something like this that Christian Science
came with its contrary announcement that all
is Spirit, and this given forth with the energy
and freshness which always accompanies the
discovery of a new aspect of truth, or, as in
this instance, the rediscovery of a world-old
truth which had been for a time despised or
forgotten. And with it came a message of
hope, the assurance that we are not the
creatures of mere circumstance, that we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
not limited to physical life, nor altogether tied
down by its limitations, that things are not as
hard and fast as they seem, and that in the
power of Spirit we can throw down many
a barrier and rise above circumstances. Most
welcome teaching, and yet to those of us
accustomed to singing, on the third evening of
the month, ‘With the help of my God I shall
leap over the wall,’ it seems strange that it
should appear quite so new! However, as
before said, Materialism had darkened much
of this old truth and somewhat blinded our
eyes. Whether, therefore, it seems new or old
to us, we can only welcome a powerful reassertion
of Idealism, of the supremacy of
Spirit, provided it come with good credentials,
and be so stated as to appeal to the best and
sanest part of ourselves, and with the breadth
and depth of treatment that so wonderful a
truth calls for. Unfortunately, it is here that
Christian Science fails us. It is a cheap, too
much ready-made Idealism that is put before
us, and one that rather appeals to our less sane
moments than to our more brilliantly illuminated
ones.</p>

<p>Idealism, by reason of its very greatness,
by its perception of things that lie outside
our senses, by its apprehension of infinities
far beyond our grasp, has many and great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
difficulties to encounter as soon as, leaving the
inspired region of Poetry, and of prophetic
vision, it tries to present itself as rational
to our intellect, and as conformable with our
knowledge of physical things. Had the foundress
of Christian Science confined herself to the
uninquiring assertions of Seership, and left
the explanation of Spiritual truths (of which
no one can deny that she caught some luminous
glimpses) to minds equipped with the necessary
knowledge and training, Christian Science would
have been shorn of much of its incoherence
and false teaching, and perhaps have proved
itself a real ally to Christianity.</p>

<p>But the foundress was not content with the
rôle of giving forth such insight as she may
have had as a Seer. She tries to explain it,
and the consequence is such a tangle of incoherent,
inconsistent, confused statements, contradictory
to each other, as has, perhaps, never
seriously been given to the world before. And
where, occasionally, the statements, at least
as to their wording, are clear and unmistakable
in their meaning, so far from clearing away
the difficulties of Idealism, they add much
to the obscurity, and leave the subject in a
position likely to act in the long run in favour
of Materialism rather than in the direction
intended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span></p>

<p>We will take an instance. Mrs. Eddy lays
great stress on the Oneness of the Universe.
Here we shall few of us quarrel with her, for
Unity is the root-idea of Thought, whether
scientific or philosophic, or even that of mere
common-sense, since it is only by Unity that
one thing can be seen in relation to another.
The Unity is, however, difficult of apprehension,
since it is essentially an idea&mdash;although none
the less real for that&mdash;being, from the physical
point of view, never seen or apprehended as a
material thing. Therefore it is non-material,
something spiritual or mental to be realised
by insight other than that of the senses. Mrs.
Eddy has this insight, and has it very strongly.</p>

<p>Idealism, however, is no sooner arrived at
than it presents us with a very hard knot to
untie, and it is here that we shall see how far
Mrs. Eddy can give us any adequate metaphysical
solution.</p>

<p>She realises, like much greater thinkers,
how hard it is to understand how our material
world can be contained in a spiritual idea,
and that Matter and Mind are of difficult
reconciliation, although, if we grant they both
exist, they are so obviously related that they
must be reconcilable within a Unity somehow.
This reconciliation has cost much thought for
thousands of years on the part of the deepest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
thinkers, but the easy way of solving the
difficulty in the case of shallow thinkers is to
do it by throwing one or other of the members
in this pair of opposites away, to deny it
existence, and so to attain a cheap conception
of unity by pronouncing either matter or mind
to be a mere illusion. The Materialist tries cancelling
Mind. Mrs. Eddy throws out Matter
and with it our entire physical world, not only
the objects in it, but all mental conceptions in
regard to it, such as the Laws of Nature, and
all possible theories as to its being a manifestation
of Mind. All our conceptions of its laws
are errors conceived by the intellect, she
teaches<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></span> which is itself non-existent. In fact,
the world only <i>is</i> because we falsely think it is.
We have only to unthink it, and it will disappear.
Spirit is One, and therefore the many
objects of the world cannot be included in it;
and only Spirit is real, therefore the material
world cannot be real. Such is her argument,
and she cannot allow that Matter may be a
manifestation of Mind or created by Mind,
or have any relation with it of whatever sort.
‘Spirit and Matter no more commingle,’ she
says, ‘than light or darkness,’ and she asserts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
that ‘Science reveals nothing in Spirit out of
which to create Matter.’</p>

<p>We have here attained, if we have attained
it, Oneness at the expense of the Many. It is
One simply by means of containing nothing,
and, in place of the inspiring conception of
the true thinker of the Unity as One because
it includes the Many harmoniously related
within itself&mdash;a Unity of infinite richness and
fecundity&mdash;we have a dead, empty One, misnamed
Unity because there is nothing to unite.
The worship of such a Oneness, it has well been
said, would be the worship of the None. Such
an One would be all-exclusive instead of all-inclusive,
and be gained by the annihilation of
everything, instead of by the inclusion of all
within Itself as the vital expression of Itself.</p>

<p>In yet another way Mrs. Eddy’s statements
concerning Unity contradict themselves. We
have seen that in her conception of Unity the
whole world, as we know it, has to be evaporated,
as it were, into nothingness, and it has
been roundly denied that Spirit had anything
to do with its creation. Yet the world has to
be accounted for, and in the sequel we find
that, according to ‘Science and Health,’ it
<i>has</i> been created&mdash;but by whom or what?</p>

<p>It has been created by the mind of Man, by
his thinking power, but not, as we shall find if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
we read the book carefully, by that part of
man’s mind that is real, but by that part of
it which is constantly asserted to be unreal,
to be, in fact, as much nothing as the world
itself is nothing. This part of Man, which is
over and over again affirmed to be nothing, is
the Mortal Mind, and is endowed with the
most tremendous creative powers; for by its
thought, its false thought, which is again
nothing, it has created for itself a world of
objects, and objects connected with each
other, not in a state of chaos, as one would
expect in a world created by false thought,
but objects connected with each other in a
marvellously ordered sequence, obeying exact
laws with the utmost obedience&mdash;laws so
elaborate and complex in their results that it
has taken Man ages to understand them even
a little (although in Mrs. Eddy’s view his
own creation), and yet, in their ordered
complexity, so simple that they are reducible
to a few heads. Such is the wonderful
world created by the Mortal Mind, and with
which God, as All-in-All, has nothing to do!
Thus we have two Creators, two unrelated
worlds, and we are landed in a Duality which
is absolutely opposed to, and inconsistent with,
the Oneness on which Mrs. Eddy lays so much
emphasis, and which consequently disappears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span></p>

<p>All the rest of Mrs. Eddy’s so-called metaphysical
ideas, her teaching on Reality, on
the nature of Man, on what constitutes truth
and what error, and so on, are equally contradictory,
and we are driven to the conclusion
that such a hopeless confusion of contradictions
is scarcely worthy of the name of Metaphysics
or of serious discussion.</p>

<p>We welcome, as we have said, so emphatic
an announcement of Idealism, and of the truth
of the supremacy of Spirit, but must deeply
regret that the Idealism is of so poor and thin
a character, and the idea of Spirit and of the
Eternal Unity so deplorably impoverished.
For, indeed, thus presented, they could not long
hold their own, and would soon give place again
to the darkness of Materialism.</p>

<p>However, rather than criticise, let us welcome
the recall to Idealism, to the recognition
of Spirit as the supreme reality in which all
physical laws find their truth, and, by a careful
study and meditation upon the length and
breadth and depth of these great ideas, as
set forth in Christianity and all that led up to it,
endeavour to do our little part towards a better
understanding of these things, and thus in
practice we shall indeed find that many a
seeming solid barrier can be overleapt, the
crooked made straight and rough places plain.</p>

<p>This book sets forth in clear and non-technical language the principles,
and the methods by which these principles have been applied, that
underlie the notable experiment in practical Christianity known as the
Emmanuel Movement. The fundamental conception of the work is that
a great number of disorders, half nervous and half moral, which are
widely prevalent in American and English society, can be alleviated and
cured by means which are psychological and religious. The book
illustrates how an alliance between the highest neurological science of
our time and the Christian religion in its primitive and simplest form,
as modern Biblical scholarship has disclosed it, may become a powerful
weapon with which to attack the causes that lie behind the neurotic and
hysterical temperament that characterises the life of to-day.</p>

<p>The work is written by two scholars trained in scientific theology,
and a physician of high reputation as an expert in psychological medicine.</p>

<p><i>The Church Times</i> says:&mdash;‘Dr. McComb’s lecture, reported in our
columns last week, has been speedily followed by the appearance of a
book, in which he and two of his colleagues give a complete account of
the work of healing undertaken at Emmanuel Church, Boston. This
seems to justify our suggestion that the limitations accepted were designed
mainly with a view to the friendly co-operation of the medical profession.
Another reason for limitation is neatly <span class="nowrap">expressed:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>‘&#8202;“In the treatment of functional nervous disorders, we make free
use of moral and psychical agencies, but we do not believe in overtaxing
these valuable aids by expecting the mind to attain results which can be
effected more easily through physical instrumentalities.”</p>

<p>‘There speaks sanctified common sense, in exact agreement with the
dictum of St. Thomas Aquinas that miracles are not to be multiplied
<i>praeter necessitatem</i>. There is also a recognition of what is presumably
true, that miraculous healing&mdash;for we prefer the old-fashioned term&mdash;is
not an easy way of escape from doctors’ bills, but a process far more
difficult, and involving far more expenditure of mind and will, than the
use of drugs or splints. When this is understood, some prejudices will
disappear. Meanwhile, the three doctors&mdash;one of medicine and two of
divinity&mdash;should have a respectful hearing for their record of work done.’</p>

<p>This little book is published under the direction of the Emmanuel Committee

<p class="tac">Crown 8vo. sewed, 6<i>d.</i> net.</p>

<p>No one will deny that psychic healing is a question of paramount
interest at the present time. It is an everyday topic of conversation in
the market place, the workshop, and in the schools. As a leader writer
in one of the chief medical papers pointed out the other day, ‘spiritual
or mental healing is going on all around us.’</p>

<p>That psychic medicine is daily becoming of more value to the community
most people probably realise, but, if not properly controlled, it
may lead to evils against which the public are entitled to be safeguarded.</p>

<p>This feeling prompted a small number of laymen to form themselves
into a Committee, and this Committee formed the nucleus of the Society
now known as the Church and Medical Union.</p>

<p>The present volume from the pen of the well-known author of ‘The
Saints in Christian Art’ is an attempt to weave into a consecutive
narrative the more important of the many legends that have in the
course of centuries gathered about the Gospel story, and reflect the
natural yearning of believers in Christ to learn all that is possible
concerning their <span class="smcap">Lord</span> from those most closely associated with His life
on earth. Founded on a great variety of sources, including the
Apocryphal New Testament, the various MS. fragments of Gospels and
Sayings of Christ that have from time to time been discovered, with
the publications inspired by them, the book will, it is hoped, appeal
alike to the serious student who delights in tracing tradition to its
fountain-head and to the wider public able to recognise, without desire
to analyse, the spiritual significance and poetic beauty of many of the
quaint tales recited in it.</p>

<p class="booktitle">THE RESURRECTION NARRATIVES AND MODERN
CRITICISM.</p>

<p class="tac">By <span class="smcap">Thomas James Thorburn</span>, B.D., LL.D.</p>

<p class="tac">Demy 8vo. 6<i>s.</i> net.</p>

<p>In this work, which is mainly a <i>critique</i> of Professor Schmeidel’s
theory that the recorded appearances of Jesus after His Crucifixion
and Death were merely subjective hallucinations on the part of the
disciples and others, the writer endeavours to show that such a view is
untenable from a psychological point of view, as well as inconsistent
with the general tenor of the Narratives themselves.</p>

<p>In the Appendices he gives in addition the Extra-Canonical
Versions of the Resurrection, together with a critical abstract of all
the various theories which up to the present time have been proposed
to explain that event, including the most recent form of the original
mythical theory of Strauss.</p>

<p>The author hopes, and believes, that the work will be of especial
use, not only to parish clergy and ministers, but also to intelligent
laymen of all classes who wish to inform themselves regarding the
developments of theological thought, and to be able to form some idea
of the value to be attached to modern critical theories dealing with
the Resurrection of Jesus.</p>

The biologist who used to expect to discover the source of life
by dissection and analysis would be rather astonished at the modern
tendency among scientific men to substitute doctrines of ‘energies’
for ‘atoms.’ As Dr. Putman has pointed out, the modern physicist
scarcely feels the need of atoms for the world of his conception.
We may even go a step further. ‘Energy’ is ‘immaterial,’ ‘consciousness’
is ‘immaterial.’ May they not accordingly have a
common denominator?</p>

The italics are mine. The Bishop is one whose statements,
made on behalf of ‘spiritual healing,’ have been accepted by
persons at any rate adequately educated. He writes a preposterous
account of ‘an abortive cancer,’ and professes to quote from
‘the latest up-to-date book on cancer, which is in the hands of
the most scientific men of to-day.’ On being asked to give the
name of the book, he says that he cannot ‘obtain the consent
of those to whom he applied.’</p>

A translation, with notes, has been edited by the Bishop of

These references to the Liturgies might be supplemented by
quotations from the patristic writings, e.g. those of Irenæus,
Tertullian, Cyril of Jerusalem, and Gregory of Nyssa. The last
named went so far as to make Baptism with faith to be the salvation
of the soul, and the partaking of the Eucharist the salvation of
the body. See Bishop Gore, <i>The Body of Christ</i>, p.&nbsp;69; and Bethune
Baker, <i>Introduction to the History of Christian Doctrine</i>, pp.&nbsp;399, 412.</p>

Kempis in regard to the power of this Sacrament. ‘The grace is
sometimes so great that out of the fulness of devotion here given
not the mind only but the weak body also feels great increase of
strength bestowed on it’ (vires sibi praestitas sentiat ampliores).

It would seem that the fuller form, ‘corpus et animum meam,’
was used by the priest at his own communion in the Mozarabic rite;
and that a similar form was prescribed in the Cologne use of the
fourteenth century for communicating the people. (Daniel, <i>Codex
Liturgicus</i>, i. pp.&nbsp;105, 147.) Otherwise the rule was as stated
above. It is interesting to note, however, that the words ‘corpus
et’ were very generally employed in administering <i>to the sick</i> in
medieval England (see the <i>York Manual</i>, Surtees, lxiii. pp.&nbsp;51, 52).</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
